Very similar rules and regulations apply in each library, but with some slight differences specified for each branch library. The book collections are created according to the scientific profile and teaching activities carried out in the faculties. The rules for collections' circulation are defined separately in each faculty library and are approved by the head of the organisational unit. Information about the collections of faculty libraries can be found in the \nAGH Libraries Catalogue\n.\n\n The collections of branch libraries consist of (situation as at 31 Dec. 2024):\n\nbooks 211 151 vol.,\n\njournals 18 156\u00a0vol.,\n\nspecial collections 48 431\u00a0items.\u00a0\n\nIn total 277 738\u00a0units of account.\n Total current periodical titles sum: 69 titles.\n\n Faculty of Civil Engineering and Resource Management \n\nBranch Library of Faculty of Civil Engineering and Resource Management\n\nAddress (location):\n\nMickiewicz\u00a0Ave. 30, building H-A1, ground floor and first floor\u00a0(entrance at the A-1 building)\n\nPhone:\n\n+48 12 617 45 77\n (circulation)\n+48 12 617 45 80\n (administration)\n\nE-mail:\n\nbibwilgz@agh.edu.pl\n\nWebsite:\n\nBranch Library\n\nOnline Catalogue:\n\nAGH Libraries Catalogue\n\nOpening hours:\n\nMon., Tue., Thu., Fri.: 9:30 am.-2:00 pm.,\n Wed.: closed,\n Sat.: 9:30 am.-2:00 pm.

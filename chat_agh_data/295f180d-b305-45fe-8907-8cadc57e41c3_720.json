Sc. Marta Fory\u015b, the Director of the Centre for International Affairs.\n\nEmbarking on this project we hope to solve the key problems the foreign academic are facing, such as difficulties with administrative and formal issues, legalisation of stay in Poland, socio-cultural adaptation or language barriers of university staff.\n\nThe project was implemented between 01.05.2022 and 30.04.2023, and the funding received for this purpose from the NAWA programme amounts to nearly PLN 400.000.", "metadata": {"url": "https://wtp.agh.edu.pl/welcome-to-poland-about-the-project/", "title": "Welcome to Poland \u2013 about the project \u2013 Welcome Point", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "26d664edfbe69c757ee77599f500e7cb", "word_count": 225, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Welcome to Poland \u2013 about the project"}]}}

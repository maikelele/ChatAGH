Methods of construction of underground piping in HDD, DP, EP technology. Drilling equipment, principles of setting down depth equipment for drilling, drilling tools. Designing and costing of works performed in trenchless technologies. \n\nThe students will acquire skills, knowledge and competences in the field of detection and repair of pipeline failures. Their construction and rehabilitation using the latest trenchless technologies. He will learn the techniques, technologies and materials used in pipeline renovation technologies. He will learn the standards applicable in the field of trenchless techniques and technologies in Poland, Ukraine and World. \n\nThe programme is co-financed by the European Social Fund under the \u2018Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development\u2019 non-competitive project entitled\u00a0 \u201cSupport for institutional capacity of Polish HEIs through establishment and implementation of international study programmes\u201d (Action: 3.3 Internationalization of Polish higher education), specified in the application for project funding no.

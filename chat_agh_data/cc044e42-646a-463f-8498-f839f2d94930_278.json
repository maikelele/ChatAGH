A university established in response to the \nneeds of a reborn country that continues to en -\nhance its social role through the development of \nscience, education, and activities that creative -\nly solve real problems of the economy. The AGH \nUST, as a university with a perennial tradition of \nexploring and explaining reality, rises tall in the \nface of new challenges arising from social, tech -\nnological, and institutional changes, the scale \nand meaning of which evade predictions and \nforecasts. Therefore, the strategy of the AGH \nUniversity of Science and Technology must, first \nand foremost, be oriented towards internal de -\nvelopment, facilitating the use of its strong suits \nto improve the university\u2019s national and inter -\nnational scientific and educational positions.\nThe previous strategy of the AGH UST, prepared \nin 2016, served its purpose well. By defining \nfundamental goals: the implementation of top-\ntier scientific research, the reliable education of \nstudents from Poland and abroad, and the effi -\ncient organisation in all areas of university ac -\ntivity, the strategy helped to consolidate the \nsignificance of the AGH UST in the region, Po -\nland, and around the world. The goals of the pre -\nvious strategy do remain valid today; however, \nnew conditions in the university environment demand that the strategy be updated, detailed, \noperationalised, and include well-defined tasks.\nThe Strategy of the AGH UST, as a university of \nvalues, shall be defined by the pursuit to imple -\nment six fundamental goals until 2026:\nIntroduction  41. Modern education attractive to students \nand the university environment in \nPoland and abroad\n2. University open to students, their \nprofessional development and passions\n3. Leading research university with a high \nstatus in Poland and around the world\n4. University oriented towards national \nand international cooperation, a leader \nin innovation and transfer of knowledge\n5. Attractive workplace for the best \nscientists, teachers, and support \nemployees\n6. Well-managed university with a modern \nand flexible structure\nThis strategy charts out directions for the ac -\ntivities planned, but by no means exhausts their \ncatalogue. It has been devised as a framework \nfor making decisions and allocating efforts and \nresources adequately to the dynamic changes in \nthe conditions of university functioning.\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\nMission, vision, \nand values of  \nthe AGH UST\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyMission, vision, and values of the AGH UST 6Mission of  \nthe AGH UST\nThe AGH UST is a university that has been contributing to \nthe common good of the society for more than a hundred \nyears by developing research and education in the fields of \ntechnical, exact, and social sciences, as well as the humanities, \nensuring the creation of technological and social inventions \nto help solve the most challenging problems of the present.\n\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyMission, vision, and values of the AGH UST 7Vision of  \nthe University  \nof the Future\nThe AGH UST has been thriving as a university \nof the future, based on a more than 100-year-\nold tradition of accepting scientific challenges, \ncreating technological solutions for the benefit \nof the economy, and fulfilling tasks that \nstem from the needs of the state, regional \ncommunities, and economic entities.\nAs a research university, the AGH UST strives to \nprovide top-tier quality in scientific research. \nAt the same time, it has been fortifying \nknowledge in the fields of technical, exact, and \nsocial sciences, as well as the humanities, by \ndeveloping research that meets the highest \ninternational standards of scientific cognition.\nThe AGH UST actively cultivates its scientific \npotential and organisational resources \nemploying them towards a comprehensive \nand sustainable development of Poland \nand Europe. It fosters cooperation with \ninternational and Polish scientific centres to \nsolve the problems of the modern world.\nThe AGH UST provides the highest level of \neducation, drawing from the achievements \nof world science. It is a university that \nlaunches innovative fields of study in \ngeneral academic and practical profiles. Graduates, capable of facing the greatest \nchallenges of the present, become leaders \nin developing the economy and society.\nOur motto:  \u2018k n o w l e d Ge \u2013 pAs s i o n  \u2013 \nb o n d s \u2019 fully transmits the principles \nupon which our university has been \nfounded and according to which it develops: \nk n o w l e d Ge means excellent standards \nof scientific cognition and fidelity in \nthe pursuit of truth and reliability\npAs s i o n  means the drive to fulfil ones\u2019 \ntasks and perseverance in implementing \nresearch and educational goals\nb o n d s  means the sense of community \nof all employees, students, doctoral \nstudents, and graduates of the AGH UST.\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyMission, vision, and values of the AGH UST 8TruthThe foundation of the ethos of the AGH UST employees, students, \nand doctoral students is the unfettered pursuit of truth, the free -\ndom to conduct scientific research, and the freedom to gain knowl -\nedge and seek solutions that best serve individuals and society.\nKnowledgeDoing science constitutes a fundamental activity of the AGH UST ac -\nademic community. As a research university, the AGH UST focuses on \ntop-tier scientific research in the fields of technical, exact, and social \nsciences, as well as the humanities, cherishing such standards of sci -\nentific cognition as reliability, innovation, interdisciplinarity, and co -\noperation with Polish and international research centres.\nIntegrityThe key principle of the AGH UST is to nurture accessibility and in -\nclusiveness in relation to all types of university activity, to make it a \nplace of equal opportunities, free from prejudice and discrimination, \nensuring safety to people working and studying here, in which re -\nspect for another human being, equal treatment, and recognition of \ndiversity constitute values that determine the norm for interperson -\nal relationships, simultaneously preserving the precedence of pursuit \nof truth and freedom of speech.\nCooperationAt the AGH UST, special importance is placed on multifaceted coop -\neration as a means to carry out scientific research and execute the \neducational process. The AGH UST creates organisational conditions \nthat are conducive to team- and interdisciplinary work. The universi -\nty resources allocation procedures favour activities based on cooper -\nation between various university departments, in particular includ -\ning research and educational projects carried out by interdisciplinary \nteams.Values of the AGH UST\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\nMission, vision, and values of the AGH UST 9RespectRespecting the activities and achievements of the members of the \nAGH UST academic community means recognising every action that \nbenefits the common good of our community. Should the capabili -\nties and resources allow it, the AGH UST supports all activities of our \nemployees and students, which contribute to the development of \nthe potential of the AGH UST, promoting responsibility and recipro -\ncal loyalty of the members of the academic community. In our em -\nployees and students, the university cultivates the following traits: \ndevotion, diligence in performing duties, and respect for intellectual \nproperty and efforts of fellow participants in joint activities.Warto\u015bci AGH  \nWell-being of studentsThe AGH UST academic community is student-oriented, which means \nthat the university places the utmost emphasis on excellent quali -\nty of education, including students in research projects and imple -\nmentation activities, creating the best possible conditions for the \ndevelopment of their own scientific pursuits. The AGH UST creates \nconditions that nurse multifarious forms of social, cultural, artis -\ntic, and sports activities of the student community. The universi -\nty strives to nurture leaders capable of taking the helm of different \ntypes of academic, economic, social, and civic activities.\nSocial responsibilityThe social responsibility of the AGH UST means taking care of estab -\nlishing and maintaining long-lasting relationships with various pro -\nfessional environments, economic entities, public administration, \nand society. These relationships are meant to serve the aforemen -\ntioned entities in solving relevant issues related to sustainable devel -\nopment, and overcoming threats to the safe existence of  humanity.\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\nAssessment of \nthe current state\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\nAssessment of the current state 11The strategy of the AGH University of Science \nand Technology is being compiled in the times \nof major unrest, increasing geopolitical threats, \nand a difficult macroeconomic perspective in \nPoland and around the world. Demograph -\nic changes, the evolution of higher education \nfunding, and the creation of a high-tech indus -\ntry that supplants the sectors established in the \nprevious century transform traditionally deter -\nmined frameworks of technical university func -\ntioning and bring about new sets of conditions. \nHowever, the changes that occur in the univer -\nsity environment constitute a chance for devel -\nopment and entry into new areas of science and \neducation due to the increasing availability of \nresearch funds in the European Union, the rein -\ndustrialisation of the European area, the recog -\nnition of lifelong learning, and the elevation of \nthe role of the best research centres.\nThe strategy of the AGH University of Science \nand Technology considers the transforming en -\nvironment, while simultaneously tapping into its \nunique resources and potential for prospective \nconsolidation of its position within scientific and \neducational circles. The potential at this univer -\nsity\u2019s disposal includes, for instance:\n \u00b7Top-tier scientific research in numerous \ndisciplines, combined with effective \ncooperation with other research centres in \nPoland and abroad \u00b7Superb educational background that \nfacilitates the introduction of modern \nteaching methods, making the transmission \nof knowledge attractive, which is an \nincentive to study at the AGH UST\n \u00b7Amazing location in the city of a remarkable \nhistory and enticing everyday life, which, \nin conjunction with the optimally placed \ncampus and comprehensive infrastructure, \nprovides technical education in a rich \nsociocultural environment.\nThe AGH UST alumni and their careers corrob -\norate the high quality of the university\u2019s edu -\ncation offer. The AGH UST graduates, who have \nestablished a unique and supportive communi -\nty, significantly influence virtually every impor -\ntant area of economic activity in Poland and in \nthe world.\nThe university also faces challenges resulting \nfrom the social and economic conditions relat -\ned to the scientific research and education sys -\ntems in Poland, and the evolution of the fields \nthat have been this institution\u2019s specialisation. \nThe major unfavourable trends that affect the \ncapabilities and strategy of the AGH UST include:\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\n \u00b7Ministry of Education and Science subsidy \nthat is difficult to predict and consider in \nprospective financial plans, which impacts \nthe implementation of multiannual \nmodernisation programmes\n \u00b7Non-competitiveness of the payroll system \nin higher education institutions, which \nsignificantly hinders keeping on the best \nemployees\n \u00b7Resigning young employees create a \ngeneration gap that retentively influences \nthe university\u2019s position in the long term\n \u00b7Piling up administrative formalities \nrelated to funding science that enforce the \nimplementation of procedures are, in many \ncases, redundant\n \u00b7Erratic policies regarding the evaluation and \nrecognition of research work, often leading \nto inappropriate publication practices \nthat consequently do not result in a real \nimprovement in the university\u2019s position in \nworld science\n \u00b7Low birth rates combined with the \ndecreasing prestige of higher education \nleading to reduction in the numbers of \nadequately prepared university candidates \nat all levels of education.\nWhat needs to be emphasised is the need to \nflexibly adapt the broad mining and metallurgy \nareas to dynamically changing socioeconomic challenges and to facilitate their synergy with \nthe service and knowledge processing industries.\nThe strategy of the AGH University of Science and \nTechnology must consider increasing threats \nand prepare the university for a period of ma -\njor unrest in both the financial and education -\nal spheres. According to traditional understand -\ning, a strategy is a document that determines \nthe long-term goals of an organisation, defin -\ning directions of development and a resource al -\nlocation plan, facilitating the implementation of \nits objectives. In this context, the AGH UST strat -\negy has been compiled under uniquely difficult \ncircumstances, when it is not entirely possible \nto determine future resources at the universi -\nty\u2019s disposal.\nThe most important strategic goal of the AGH \nUniversity of Science and Technology shall be \nthe development of scientific research and ac -\nademic competencies of its employees in con -\njunction with comprehensive education, attrac -\ntive in its form and methods, as well as adjusted \nto the current and future needs of the market. A \nhigh quality of research and education shall be \nachieved through organisational prowess and \nthe improvement of conditions for the develop -\nment of research and educational work, so that \njoint and individual successes of the employees \ncould integrate the university team.\nAssessment of the current state 12\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technology\nStrategic goals\n\nModern education \nattractive to students \nand the university \nenvironment in \nPoland and abroad\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 15strategic  goal  1\nModern education \nattractive to students \nand the university \nenvironment in \nPoland and abroad\nThe level of scientific research and the quality of education equally \ndetermine the position of the AGH UST in academic circles. The roles \nof a university comprise the creation of knowledge and its responsi -\nble dissemination, which must concur with the high quality of educa -\ntion achieved by modifying programmes of study based on insightful \nobservation of the needs of stakeholders, opening up to internation -\nal students, developing specialised higher-level education, and up -\ndating the quality of services provided to students.\nEducation interacting with  \nthe environment \n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 16Strategic goal 1 \nModern education attractive to students and  \nthe university environment in Poland and abroad\nOperational goal 1\nImproving the quality  \nof educationThe AGH UST organises numerous courses \nand training sessions for academic teachers, \naiming to improve their competences and \nexpand their knowledge in the fields of new \nteaching methods and techniques. Reward \nmechanisms have also been established \nto appreciate the educational activity of \nthe most valued employees. The reward \nsystem should improve the process of \nintroducing modern methods of education. \nThese activities shall be implemented by: \u00b7Developing the Education Support System, implementing \nmodern educational methods\n \u00b7Improving the system that elevates educational work (reward \nsystem, promotions, etc.), creating an HR policy that supports \nthe development of educational competences, and ensuring \nflexibility in the distribution of hours in the teaching load\n \u00b7Implementing an integrated IT system throughout the university \nto facilitate flexibility in determining individual programmes of \nstudy with greater freedom to choose elective courses.\nA steady progression regarding the \nmethods and tools verifying the quality \nof education and the educational and \nresearch facilities shall be achieved \nthrough: \u00b7Implementing a mechanism for consistent monitoring and \nimproving the University System for Education Quality Assurance \nand educational auditing in order to adjust the educational \nprocess to the changing needs and expectations, and to \neliminate undesirable phenomena\n \u00b7Designing and implementing a university-wide programme for \nthe development of educational infrastructure\n \u00b7Designing and implementing mechanisms for the integration of \nthe educational process with scientific research.\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 17Operational goal 2\nAdjusting the education offer to \ncurrent needs and expectationsThe AGH UST aims to continuously improve \nthe educational process and make it \nattractive both in terms of the fields and \nlevels of study, and the way of conducting \nclasses. Adjusting the education offer to \nthe constantly changing conditions and \nexpectations of employers and university \ncandidates takes precedence. The activities \nin this regard shall encompass, in particular, \nthe following: \u00b7Creating an education offer in cooperation with the \nsocioeconomic environment\n \u00b7Intensifying promotional activities, expanding cooperation \nwith schools, and creating an automated advisory system for \ncandidates\n \u00b7Improving elite education mechanisms for the best candidates, \nwhile simultaneously retaining an offer for moderately prepared \ncandidates\n \u00b7Expanding the offer of multidisciplinary programmes, launching \nthe Multidisciplinary Studies School\n \u00b7Expanding the offer included in the University Database of \nElectives and individualising education (e.g. tutoring)\n \u00b7Implementing modern techniques and methods of \ncommunication.\nOperational goal 3\nImproving the attractiveness of \nsecond-cycle programmesMultiple levels of education provide a \nchance to acquire new candidates for \nsecond-cycle programmes, also from \nother research institutions. To use this \nopportunity, the AGH UST places great \nemphasis on creating an attractive \neducation offer in second-cycle \nprogrammes. Activities in this field shall \nfocus on: \u00b7Transforming selected specialties into new fields of study \n(shortening the admissions process to specialties)\n \u00b7Developing and implementing a system of incentives to continue \neducation in the second cycle for the AGH UST first-cycle \ngraduates\n \u00b7Adjusting the algorithm for subsidy allocation to acquire funds \nfor the development and implementation of attractive, flexible, \nand individual programmes of study in the second cycle.Strategic goal 1 \nModern education attractive to students and  \nthe university environment in Poland and abroad\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 18Operational goal 4\nImproving the position of  \nthe AGH UST in international \neducation circlesImproving the position of the AGH UST in \ninternational education circles constitutes \nan important direction for future activities. \nThe most important tasks in this field \ninclude: \u00b7Developing and increasing the efficiency of the \ninternationalisation of the educational process at the AGH UST \nand participating in international educational initiatives (joint \neducation and programmes)\n \u00b7Developing cooperation in the field of joint education with \nforeign universities and institutions (double degree and joint \ndiploma programmes), considering global trends, including the \nso-called \u2018STEM\u2019 approach.\nOperational goal 5\nImplementing further education  \nin cooperation with economic  \nand research circlesConsidering the need to consult the \neducation offer with business and \neconomic circles, as well as the local \ngovernment, the university plans include: \u00b7Developing detailed solutions related to cooperation between \nthe university and the economic and research environments, \nspanning part-time studies and non-degree postgraduate \nprogrammes\n \u00b7Creating a broad offer of further education (FE) courses and \ntrainings\n \u00b7Developing and implementing a comprehensive formula for \nfurther education with a system of \u2018short-term courses\u2019 and \nother modern forms of commercial education.Strategic goal 1 \nModern education attractive to students and  \nthe university environment in Poland and abroad\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 19\nKey indicators to \nmonitor strategic \ngoal 1 include, \nin particular: \u00b7Number of fields of study, including those \ncreated in cooperation with the business \nenvironment\n \u00b7Number of student publications (number of \nstudents participating in grants and projects)\n \u00b7Percentage of students continuing education \n(percentage of first-cycle students continuing \neducation in the second cycle)\n \u00b7Number of second-cycle students\n \u00b7Percentage of fields of study taught in English \ncompared to the number of all fields of study\n \u00b7Ratio of international students to all \nuniversity students in comparison to other \nEuropean Union and OECD countries\n \u00b7Percentage of business specialists in the \neducational process\n \u00b7Number of implementations of modern \neducation techniques and methods.Strategic goal 1 \nModern education attractive to students and  \nthe university environment in Poland and abroad\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 20\nUniversity  \nopen to students,  \ntheir professional \ndevelopment  \nand passions\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 21strategic  goal  2\nUniversity  \nopen to students,  \ntheir professional \ndevelopment  \nand passions\nA high quality of education at the AGH UST is not only based on the \nprofessionalism and knowledge of its employees, but also requires \nan adequate system of support for students, ensuring inclusiveness \nand welfare safety of the academic community and the possibility of \nversatile individual development. To this end, the university estab -\nlishes a variety of scholarship programmes and systems to support \nthe development of interests and competences of students. The AGH \nUST also responds to the current problems of the academic commu -\nnity, developing a system of psychological support for students and \ntaking steps to increase the community\u2019s awareness of the needs of \npeople who seek that support, including people with disabilities.

However, there is still a \nneed to improve and increase the level of \ncommercialisation of research tasks carried \nout at the university. The following actions \nshall be introduced to achieve this goal: \u00b7Increasing the effectiveness of the innovation brokers network \n(knowledge and technology scouting) \u2013 developing and \nimplementing a system to measure and evaluate brokers\u2019 \nperformance\n \u00b7Intensifying cooperation with the socioeconomic environment \nto increase the number of implementations, projects, and R&D \nagreements\n \u00b7Providing systemic support for the process of intellectual \nproperty protection, considering its commercial potential\n \u00b7Improving a support system for the processes of transfer and \ncommercialisation of knowledge and technology.Strategic goal 4 \nUniversity oriented towards national and \ninternational cooperation, a leader in innovation \nand transfer of knowledge\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 36Operational goal 4\nSupporting entrepreneurship  \nand the processes of establishing \nstart-ups and spin-offsSupporting the establishment of academic \ntechnological start-ups and developing \nbusiness based on knowledge and modern \ntechnologies, orbiting primarily around \nthe INNOAGH Krakow Centre of Innovative \nTechnologies, shall be developed by:  \u00b7Defining career paths and support actions for scientists and \ndoctoral students who will decide to commercialise the results of \ntheir research on their own\n \u00b7Attempting to establish the AGH UST Technology Park with an \nentrepreneurship and innovation incubator\n \u00b7Building a competent team of experts to support the process of \ninitiating, establishing, and developing start-ups and spin-offs.\nOperational goal 5\nIncreasing the participation of  \nthe AGH UST in the creation  \nof normative documentsIn reality, almost every aspect of public, \nsocial, and economic life is governed by \nvarious types of norms and standards. In \nthe intricate and interconnected global \neconomy, norms perform a crucial function \nand contribute to ensuring the quality \nof services and products, improving \nthe standard of living, and the overall \nfunctioning of institutions regardless of \nindustry. Research and science centres, \nincluding the AGH UST, play a vital \nrole in the development of normative \ndocuments and standards. The university \nshall introduce the following activities to \nactively shape such documents: \u00b7Increasing activity in the work of normative committees\n \u00b7Increasing the number of accredited laboratories (solutions for \nelectromobility, hydrogen technologies, energy technologies)\n \u00b7Maintaining a registry of laboratories operating at the AGH \nUST, and carrying out regular inspections to check activity, \ninfrastructure, purchasing, and investment-related needs.Strategic goal 4 \nUniversity oriented towards national and \ninternational cooperation, a leader in innovation \nand transfer of knowledge\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 37Key indicators to \nmonitor strategic \ngoal 4 include, \nin particular: \u00b7Number/sum of implementations\n \u00b7Number of ongoing pre-implementation \nactivities\n \u00b7Number of activities supporting \ncommercialisation\n \u00b7Number of registered intangible assets\n \u00b7Number of experts/people involved in \nactivities supporting the development of \nstar t-ups\n \u00b7Number of normative acts introduced with the \ndirect participation of AGH UST employees\n \u00b7Number of accredited laboratories\n \u00b7Number of R&D&I grants carried out in \nconsortia with entrepreneurs\n \u00b7Revenues from the commercialisation of the \nresults of research and development work, \nknow-how, patents, and licences\n \u00b7Number of inventions for which the university \nhas obtained a European patent or an \ninternational patent in at least one of the \ncountries belonging to the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development\n \u00b7Revenues and incomes from the commercial \nactivity of the AGH UST and INNOAGH.\nStrategic goal 4 \nUniversity oriented towards national and \ninternational cooperation, a leader in innovation \nand transfer of knowledge\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 38\nAttractive workplace \nfor the best scientists, \nteachers, and support \nemployees\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 39strategic  goal  5\nAttractive workplace \nfor the best scientists, \nteachers, and support \nemployees\nThe development of the AGH UST depends on the competencies, in -\nvolvement, and cooperation of all university employees. The AGH UST \nstrives to create such conditions for its employees to allow them to \nachieve their personal goals in compliance with the strategic goals \nof the university, simultaneously ensuring a satisfactory \u2013 finan -\ncial and non-financial \u2013 recognition for individual involvement. The \nAGH UST plans to fulfil this strategic goal by determining unequivocal \ndefinitions of HR policy priorities, determining clear long-term career \npath scenarios, and increasing possibilities for personal development \nwithin competently managed teams, including the creation of an in -\nternational and active work environment. This strategic goal shall be \nachieved through the implementation of several operational goals.\nPersonal fulfilment, \ndevelopment, and support\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 40Operational goal 1\nOptimising the HR policy \nsystem, ensuring quantitative \nand qualitative development of \nstaff potential at the university \nin accordance with the strategic \ngoals of the universityStrategic goal 5 \nAttractive workplace for the best scientists, \nteachers, and support employees\nThe AGH UST employees constitute a group \nthat is well-prepared and competent, \nalbeit diverse, in terms of research \nachievements and the level of involvement \nin activities for the benefit of the \nuniversity. The staff appraisal system does \nnot allow the authorities to fully appreciate \nthe best employees, and it sometimes does \nnot provide enough incentive to develop \nresearch interests and participate in the \nfunctioning of the university. To optimise \nthe HR policy system, the university shall \nintroduce the following actions: \u00b7Improving HR policies focused on developing the research \nand educational potential of the university by codifying rules \nand regulations of: internal competitions and promotions, \napproval for changing positions, employment of pensioners, and \nadditional employment of employees\n \u00b7Improving the appraisal system of academic staff, including \nthe ongoing monitoring of results; performing a review and \nthen modifying the appraisal system so that it can deliver \nongoing support in the management of professional careers of \nemployees.\nOperational goal 2\nDeveloping a system of employing \nforeign academic staffInternational cooperation, including \nthe exchange of researchers and the \nemployment of foreign scientists, is a \nnecessary condition for the continued \ngrowth of the university. The AGH UST and \nKrakow can be attractive workplaces for \nthe best professionals, provided that there \nis a comprehensive offer of employment \nfor national and international employees, \nas well as versatile administrative support, \nin both the adaptation process and \nthe research and educational activity. \nAcquiring the best employees, including \nforeigners, shall be achieved especially by: \u00b7Developing and implementing effective procedures for \ndisseminating information on competitions, reaching targeted \nenvironments in Poland and abroad\n \u00b7Developing an adaptation programme for new employees, \nespecially those from abroad.\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 41Operational goal 3\nImproving payroll policy  \nfocusing on rewarding employees \ninvolved in the development  \nof the universityThe university payroll system is not \ncompetitive in relation to the conditions \nof the job market, primarily because it \nis based on centrally distributed public \nmoney. The university intends to increase \nthe motivational role of salaries by \nincreasing the funds obtained from sources \nother than the subsidy and by adjusting \nthe payroll system to tie employee \nincomes more closely with the results of \ntheir work. Improving the quality of work \nshall be achieved through the following \nprocesses: \u00b7Improving the rules of rewarding all employees for effectiveness, \nefficiency, competence, and creativity\n \u00b7Developing and improving a payroll policy related to promotions \nand academic degrees and titles\n \u00b7Developing and improving tools of rewarding employees for \nexceptional achievements in the fields of education, research and \ninnovation activity, cooperation with the university environment, \nand actions for the benefit of the university, including refining \nprocedures that facilitate flexibility in the distribution of hours in \nthe teaching load\n \u00b7Developing and improving support systems for acquiring funding \nfor research, including administrative support in preparing grant \napplications and requisite financial support related to procedures.\nOperational goal 4\nIncreasing opportunities  \nfor personal development  \nand the improvement of  \nemployee competencesThe university aims to provide substantial \nsupport to the personal development of \nemployees \u2013 both in the group of academic \nteachers as well as other university \nemployees \u2013 in accordance with modern \ntrends in human resources management. \nThe following actions shall be taken in the \narea of professional competences: \u00b7Increasing opportunities for personal development of employees \nby expanding the offer of foreign language courses and IT \ntrainings, including those related to the use of modern teaching \nmethods in education and other courses that support teaching \nskills\n \u00b7Increasing personalisation of available development paths for \nthe purpose of taking into consideration the diverse needs of \nemployees, providing equal access to them, and an incentive \nto continue versatile education both in the field of professional \ncompetences and creative non-professional interests.Strategic goal 5 \nAttractive workplace for the best scientists, \nteachers, and support employees\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 42Operational goal 5\nDeveloping support and self-help \nsystems ensuring satisfaction  \nand stability in the personal lives  \nof employeesThe university will support activities \nrelated to further education and non-\nprofessional development of personal \ninterests of employees, as well as \nmaintaining inter-generation relationships, \nalso with pensioners and families of AGH \nUST employees. The main activities in this \narea shall include: \u00b7Developing and improving employee support programmes, \nincluding those for pensioners within the framework of social \nwelfare\n \u00b7Expanding non-financial motivational programmes facilitating \nthe development of employees\u2019 interests; this pertains to leisure \ntime, physical activity, and the cultural sphere\n \u00b7Improving mental health support programmes for employees, \ndeveloping a support programme for employees in crisis, and \ndisseminating information on the possibilities of reaching out for \nhelp\n \u00b7Maintaining and improving support programmes for employees \nin a difficult housing situation; such programmes will provide a \nfair and objectively justified temporal support, and introducing \nthem will be preceded by an audit of the current system and an \nindication of the areas in need of urgent changes\n \u00b7Improving procedures to counteract discrimination and \ninappropriate relations in the place of work and education. \nA safe and comfortable atmosphere in any workplace is a key con -\ndition for permanent development. The university shall adamantly \noppose any forms of discrimination regarding sex, religion, age, and \nother personal traits. To ensure this, the AGH UST will expand the pro -\ngramme allowing employees to report problems safely and quick -\nly, requesting intervention in interpersonal relations between col -\nleagues.Strategic goal 5 \nAttractive workplace for the best scientists, \nteachers, and support employees\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 43Operational goal 6\nOptimising  \nand computerising  \nprocesses related to  \nthe management  \nof employee mattersEfficient university management requires \noptimal cooperation between research \nand educational teams at faculties, \nfaculty administrations, and central \nadministration. The procedures tend to be \noverly bureaucratised, and documents are \nnot always verified and accepted on time, \nwhich, to a considerable degree, stems \nfrom the lack of an electronic document \ncirculation system, which would facilitate \nthe execution of university tasks promptly \nand in compliance with regulations. The \nuniversity will develop an IT solution to \nsupport the circulation of documents and \nother employee services, and the following \ntasks shall constitute the most important \nactivities: \u00b7Introducing the alignment of human resources processes with \nthe principles and regulations in force in the European Union, \ne.g. HR Excellence in Research (HRS4R \u2013 The Human Resources \nStrategy for Researchers)\n \u00b7Implementing document standardisation related to human \nresources processes\n \u00b7Implementing and optimising cooperation and information \nexchange procedures between central and faculty \nadministrations.

One of the challenges for the AGH UST is \nto update the university management system and redesign it to fit \nthe needs of a research university that integrates academic inves -\ntigation and transmission of knowledge at the highest level. IT sup -\nport constitutes an indispensable condition for success; however, the \nquality of internal processes and relationships between university \nunits also require reinvention. The AGH UST will support the develop -\nment of participative management that integrates employee teams \naround common goals. The university wants to be unequivocally \nidentified as a socially responsible institution, aware of contempo -\nrary civilisational challenges, including those related to the environ -\nment, which minimises the ecological footprint and teaches its stu -\ndents about the significance of sustainable development.\nMultidimensional sustainable \ndevelopment\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 47Operational goal 1\nEstablishing an optimal  \nand flexible organisational \nstructure, based on units \nplaying different roles (research \nand educational activities) \ncrucial to the functioning of \na modern universityThe impermanence of conditions in \nwhich the university functions forces \nits organisational structure to adapt \nto current and foreseeable challenges. \nTendencies in employing graduates, \nevolving popularity of various fields \nof study, and new trends in academic \ninvestigations and research funding \ncompel the university to monitor the \nphenomena in its surroundings and \nconsider them in its research, financial, \nand organisational perspectives. Strategic \nplans regarding university functioning in \nthe area of optimising the organisational \nstructure include: \u00b7Continuously analysing and, should the need arise, modifying \nspecific rules of basic unit activity within the AGH UST structure, \nincluding the rules of establishing and dissolving units, and the \nrules of implementing recovery programmes \n \u00b7Continuously adjusting the structure of the university and \nparticular AGH UST units to current requirements resulting from \nthe development of science and the socioeconomic environment, \nincluding modern fields of knowledge, prospective branches \nof the economy, changes in the job market, and directions of \ndomestic and international cooperation\n \u00b7Designing the rules for establishing and functioning of \ninterfaculty units to optimise and improve the quality of the \neducational process in related fields of study\n \u00b7Designing the rules for establishing and functioning, as well as \nlaunching an interdisciplinary education system (in the first \nand second cycles) in fields of study taught at the university \nwith possible participation of partners from other universities, \nresearch institutes, companies, and international institutions.Strategic goal 6 \nWell-managed university with a modern \nand flexible structure\n\ns tr ategy  of the agh universit y  of science  and technologyStrategic goals 48Operational goal 2\nIntroducing modern rules of \nuniversity management using \nthe instruments of enterprise \narchitecture frameworkA modern university must have an efficient \ninternal organisational system, well-\ndefined goals, and adequate decision-\nmaking procedures. Reaching efficiency \nin management requires the university to \nimplement IT tools that support decision-\nmaking processes and task assignment and \naccountability. To achieve this, the AGH UST \nintends to take the following actions: \u00b7Improving management mechanisms, including upgrading \nthe tools for financial and managerial accounting, financial \nmanagement, ownership supervision, as well as supporting the \nimprovement of managerial skills of directors and heads of units \nthrough an adequate training scheme\n \u00b7Introducing an electronic document circulation system and \nadequate solutions supporting management at all levels of the \norganisational structure\n \u00b7Developing methodology and analytical tools to continuously \ninspect the university\u2019s position in Polish and international \nresearch and educational environments\n \u00b7Developing a comprehensive system to monitor the functioning \nof university units, including their expenses, and to monitor the \nstatus of strategy implementation\n \u00b7Redesigning the system of creating and publishing internal \nregulations, as well as the way of controlling and verifying its \nconcordance with external law.\nOperational goal 3\nImplementing the concept \nof a digital universityEffective university management requires \na comprehensive and well-designed IT \ninfrastructure. Most of the processes that \nare currently being conducted with the use \nof paper documents should be transposed \nto the digital form, and this is crucial to \nimprove management and increase the \nsecurity of procedures.

The \nstrategic goals are general in nature and must \nbe read in the context of the entire institution. \nImplementing the strategy across the entire \nuniversity is a process that requires the disag -\ngregation and cascading of general goals to the \nlevel of particular units, in a form tailored to their \nspecificity and capabilities. In the process of im -\nplementing the strategy of the AGH UST, respec -\ntive university units shall prepare strategy im -\nplementation framework programmes, in which \nthey will indicate specific goals, time frames, \nand implementation stages, in compliance with \nthe general strategic goals. The framework pro -\ngrammes shall be analysed by university au -\nthorities and, after being endorsed, they will \nform strategies of respective units, compliant \nwith the strategic goals of the university. An -\nnual consultations between the university au -\nthorities and unit heads, related to problems \nand needs regarding the implementation of the \nframework programmes and their compliance \nwith the university goals, shall serve as the ele -\nment of monitoring the status of the implemen -\ntation of the strategy.\nThe set of goals indicated in the strategy and \ntheir co-dependencies create a complex network, \nchanging dynamically under the influence of the \nsurroundings and other necessary adjustments. Compared to enterprises, oriented towards eco -\nnomic indicators, the university must also focus \non goals in the following dimensions: scientif -\nic, educational, social, economic, technological, \netc., which cannot be unequivocally ordered \nin terms of their superiority and importance. \nTherefore, considering its social tasks, the uni -\nversity must monitor its activities to a wider ex -\ntent than commercial enterprises, even those \nthat have implemented a sustainability charter.\nAt the AGH UST, the status of the implementation \nof the strategy will be monitored by analysing \nchanges in the factors presented in the descrip -\ntion of the six fundamental strategic goals of \nthe university. Continuous analysis will be per -\nformed by comparing indicators at the univer -\nsity level with the indicators of the status of the \nimplementation of framework programmes by \nuniversity units. The conclusions reported shall \nserve to adjust the tasks of the university and its \nunits, and to adequately allocate money to vari -\nous programmes.\nImplementation and monitoring of the strategy 53\n\n", "metadata": {}}

Tasks to solve for students.\n\nSampling of mineral, thermal, and curative water samples \u2013 practical aspects related to sampling process, requirements regarding to type of bottles, type of preservatives used, samples transport and storage, QA/QC in sampling. This part was conducted in the form of the field works - students take water samples from the piezometer on their own.\n\nAnalysis of collected water samples in accredited hydrogeochemical laboratory of the AGH University \u2013 workshops.\n\nHydrogeochemical data verification, types of errors, introduction to statistics \u2013 computer classes.\n\nMethodological aspects of groundwater and curative water quality assessment with the use of PS IMAGO PRO software (control charts) and GWSDAT software (monotonic trend assessment) \u2013 computer classes.\n\nThe programme is co-financed by the European Social Fund under the \u2018Operational Programme Knowledge Education Development\u2019 non-competitive project entitled \u201cSupport for institutional capacity of Polish HEIs through establishment and implementation of international study programmes\u201d (Action: 3.3 Internationalization of Polish higher education), specified in the application for project funding no. POWR.03.03.00-00-PN16 /18).\n\nContribution of European Funds: PLN 528 526,90\n\n\u00a0The projects are implemented under the program of the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange - SPINAKER - Intensive International Education Programs.\u00a0The program is financed from the non-competition project no.

As glaciers melt at an alarming rate, water cycles  become unpredictable, threatening communities, ecosystems, and water  security. This year\u2019s theme highlights the urgent need to reduce carbon  emissions and manage meltwater sustainably. At AGH University, we are  committed to research and education that support climate action and  water resource protection. Together, we can safeguard our frozen water  reserves for future generations. Join us in raising awareness and taking  action for a sustainable water future.", "metadata": {"url": "http://www.unesco.agh.edu.pl/aktualnosci/world-water-day-2025/", "title": "World Water Day 2025", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "233245206b9ee81ef90655fd10f4a3fa", "word_count": 98, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "UNESCO AGH Chair Celebrates World Water Day 2025"}]}}

Dagmara Stasiowska \n\n 06-03-2025 \n\n PhD defended! Dagmara Stasiowska joins the ranks of PhD engineers at the Space Technology Centre AGH! \n\nWe are proud to announce that on\u00a0\nMarch 3, 2025\n,\u00a0\nM.Sc. Eng. Dagmara Stasiowska\n\u00a0successfully defended her PhD thesis titled\u00a0\n\u201cThe assessment of the usefulness of the biocybernetic model of a bee colony to predict the effects of giving the queen bee stress associated with space flight\u201d\n.\n\nThe thesis was supervised by\u00a0\nProf. Dr. hab. Eng. Ryszard Tadeusiewicz\n, with\u00a0\nDr. Micha\u0142 Kolasa\n\u00a0serving as the assistant supervisor.\n\nCongratulations! This is a tremendous achievement and another step forward in the research on the impact of space conditions on living organisms.\n\nAlthough she has just defended her PhD, this is not the end of her accomplishments.\u00a0\nDr. Eng. Dagmara Stasiowska\n\u00a0is also involved in the\u00a0\nMXene in LEO\n\u00a0experiment, part of\u00a0\nIGNIS\n\u00a0\u2013 Poland\u2019s first technological and scientific mission to the International Space Station.\n\nThe\u00a0\nIGNIS\n\u00a0mission, scheduled for the spring of 2025, marks a groundbreaking moment for Polish science and space technology. As part of the\u00a0\nMXene in LEO\n\u00a0experiment, innovative materials will be studied for their potential applications in the extreme conditions of space.\n\nOnce again, congratulations to\u00a0\nDr. Eng. Dagmara Stasiowska\n, and we wish her continued success!\n\nBack", "metadata": {"url": "https://ctk.agh.edu.pl/en/news/detail/a-phd-on-a-space-related-topic-successfully-defended-dr-eng-dagmara-stasiowska", "title": "A PhD on a space-related topic successfully defended! - Dr. Eng.

If you have questions regarding required documents, contact your preferred bank via phone.\n\nCan I open a bank account as a non-resident?\n\nThe best thing to do is to check with the banks to see what their individual requirements are. Some of them have a foreigner-friendly policy and only ask for proof of identity, in most cases a passport, and in addition they may also require proof of residence in the country where you live or PESEL number.\n\nExamples of banks in Poland:\n\nAlior Bank\n\nBank Millenium\n\nBank Pekao\n\nBNP Paribas\n\nCredit Agricole\n\nING Bank \u015al\u0105ski\n\nmBank\n\nPKO BP\n\nSantander Bank Polska\n\nPlease check each bank\u2019s website to see what documents are required, as this may vary.", "metadata": {"url": "https://wtp.agh.edu.pl/bank-account/", "title": "Bank account \u2013 Welcome Point", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "0fd1af1b4351fd52840d8d5ac7be16e1", "word_count": 302, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Bank account"}, {"level": 2, "text": "What documents do I need to open a bank account in Poland?"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Here are the documents that will be required when opening a bank account:"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Can I open a bank account as a non-resident?"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Examples of banks in Poland:"}]}}

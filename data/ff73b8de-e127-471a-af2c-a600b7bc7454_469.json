What I really enjoy \nabout Krakow is its \nsecurity because all the \npeople respect you and \nyou can go alone with \nno problems at all. It's \na very nice place to meet \nnew people because in \nKrakow everybody is very \nopen-minded and willing \nto share their experiences \nwith you. In fact, it is the \nideal place to come if you \nare from Latin America and \nyou are looking for a nice \nplace to stay, take part in \nSMILE Program, Krakow is \nthe ideal place for you.\nJos\u00e9 Carlos Guzm\u00e1n Vera\nAlumno del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico \nNacional  /  Mexico\n\n\nCampus life\nAll of AGH University buildings are located in one district in \nthe centre of Krakow and cover the area of 40 ha. An integral \npart of the university complex is the largest student campus \nin Poland, the AGH University Student Campus (in Polish: \nMiasteczko Studenckie AGH), covering the area of 13 ha.\nStudent dormitories ensure comfortable living conditions \u2013 access to the Internet, areas \ndedicated for learning, facilities for the disabled, TV rooms, and club rooms. Regular \nrenovations and refurbishments are made to keep the room standard at a high level. The \nstudent campus offers nearly 8,000 beds in 20 student dormitories. In July, August, and \nSeptember, the AGH University Student Campus becomes the largest summer hostel in Krakow. \nAGH University students are represented by the AGH University Student Council which \norganises the legendary annual student festival called Juwenalia. There are about 360 cultural \nevents held in 4 student clubs, as well as many scientific and sporting events organized every \nyear at the university campus. The university also hosts the University Board of Doctoral \nStudents\u2019 Government, the AGH University Independent Students\u2019 Union, and the  \nAGH University Section of Erasmus Student Network (ESN) which supports international \nstudents at each stage of their stay.\nThe AGH University campus is located in the heart of Krakow. The AGH University Main \nBuilding is only 1 kilometre away from the Main Market Square, hence it is possible to walk \nthe distance within a\u00a0few minutes. Getting to the Main Railway Station in Krakow, thanks to \nan extensive network of trams and buses, takes only 10 minutes, and getting to the  \nJohn Paul II International Airport Krakow-Balice about 30 minutes.\n08\n\nI\u2019m an Erasmus + student for one year in \nKrakow, at the AGH University of Krakow. This \nbig campus that the University offers is a great \nplace for students with a lot of activities. Playing \nfootball, basketball, volleyball, tennis is usual \nhere. There you can also spend some time with \nyour friends because there are a couple of bars \nand restaurants. I really like to be here, it gathers \nmany students from everywhere and you can \nmeet many different cultures. This adventure is \nsomething incredible and I\u2019m sure that I will miss \nit when I leave Miasteczko Studenckie AGH.\nAntoine Pillot\nIAE University in Lille  /  FranceONLY 1 km\nAGH University Main Building Main Market Square\n09\n138interest  \ngroups\n29student  \norganisations\nThe AGH University  \nStudent Campus\n\n\nThe Campus \u2013 a city within a city\na health centre a kindergarten a nursery school a pharmacy20 student dormitories, \nnearly 8,000 bedseating  \nestablishmentsshops and service-\nproviding facilities4 student  \nclubs\na football pitch volleyball and \nbasketball courtstennis courts a swimming pool \n(Basen AGH)One of the biggest AGH University assets is the University Campus which is home to the \nuniversity administration, student organisations, sports and leisure facilities.

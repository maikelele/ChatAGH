The three laboratories within the research group each have unique focuses and goals that contribute to our understanding of how organisms and humans can thrive in space environments.\u00a0\n\nOverall, this research group is making significant contributions to our understanding of the impacts of space travel on living organisms and human health, and is helping to advance the field of space biology and biomedical engineering.\u00a0\n\nThe Space Biology Laboratory is exploring the biological effects of spaceflight conditions on living organisms, including the role of gravity on amyloid formation and its implications for astronauts' health. Research areas include bioenergetics, gene expression, and the development of bioactive substances for space travel. Understanding these effects can help in developing preventative measures and life support systems for future space missions.\u00a0\n\nThe Habitat for analog astronaut missions provides a unique facility for training astronauts and testing technologies planned for space missions. Research topics include the impact of extreme environments on human physiology and behavior, as well as the development of early warning systems and cybersecurity protocols for space missions. The habitat serves as a valuable testing ground for technologies before they are launched into orbit.\u00a0\n\nThe Space Biomedical Engineering Laboratory is dedicated to studying disease prevention and aging processes in space and on Earth. By leveraging nutraceuticals and innovative technologies, the lab aims to develop solutions for combating chronic diseases and improving health outcomes for astronauts and the general population. Research areas include personalized medicine, organ-on-chip technology, and the development of materials for health monitoring in space.\u00a0\n\nStopka\n\nResearch\n\nProjects\n\nContact\n\nLogo to download\n\nBack", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ctk.agh.edu.pl/en/research-groups/life-science-for-space", "title": " Life Science for Space -- Space Technology Centre ", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "00c7012d6c82f62a066a2a06caf8cb3d", "word_count": 294, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Life Science for Space"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Stopka"}]}}

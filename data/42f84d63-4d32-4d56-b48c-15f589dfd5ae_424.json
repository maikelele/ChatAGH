Arriving at work on  time means being present at the workstation ready to perform \nemployees\u2019 duties at the time specified as the start ing time. \n3. If the attendance register is not signed, the employee is presumed to be absent and not \nworking, and the burden of proof in this cas e lies with the employee.  \n4. The attendance of employees at their workstations is checked on an ongoing basis by the \nemployees' immediate supervisors.  \n5. The immediate superior of an absent employee must designate an employee to replace \nthe employee during their  absence.  \n\u00a7 18 \n1.

Employees may be present on the premises after working hours or on a day off only with \nthe approval of their superior . The mere presence on the premises before or after working \nhours or on a day off does not constitute overtime unless the superior has at t he same \ntime ordered the employee to work outside standard working hours.  \n3. Leaving the workplace without authorisation constitutes a gross violation of work \ndiscipline and results in the employee being held accountable.  \nExcusing Absences from Work  \n\u00a7 19 \n1.

A subsequent  health leave may be granted no earlier than 3 years after the end of the \nprevious leave.  \n4. The total duration of the health leave in the entire period of employment may not exceed \nthree  years. \n5. During a health leave, the academic teacher may not engage in any gainful activity.  \n\u00a7 39 \n1. During the leaves referred to in \u00a7 34 \u201338, the academic teacher is entitled to remuneration \npursuant to Article 135(2) of the Act.  \n2. The periods of leave referred to in this chapter are included in the period of work which \ndetermines employees\u2019 entitlements.  \nSECTION III  \nWORKING TIME  \nChapter I  \nGeneral Pr ovisions  \n\u00a7 40 \n1. Working time is the time during which the employee remains at the disposal of the \nemployer in the workplace or in another place designated for work.  \n2. The working time (working time standard) of all employees of the University is 8 hours \nper day and an average of 40 hours per week in an average five -day working week in \nan adopted settlement period.  \n3. (deleted)  \n4. Working time for employees who work in conditions harmful to health must not exceed \n8 hours per day.  \n5. Subject to item 6, the fact that the employee is present on the University \u2019s premises \nbefore or after working time is not considered overtime.  \n6. Being present on the premises of the University outside the employee's working time \nconstitutes overtime work onl y if work is actually performed for the employer on the \nsupervisor's instructions.  \n\u00a7 40a \n1. The working time of employees with disabilities must not exceed 8 hours a day and 40 \nhours a week.  \n2. The working time of employees who hold a certificate of moder ate or severe disability \nmust not exceed 7 hours a day and 35 hours a week.  \n3. A person with a disability must not be employed during night -time and work overtime.  \n4. The provisions of items 1 -3 do not apply to:  \n\nPage 23 of 56 \n 1) persons employed as guards and  \n2) cases when, at the request of the employee, the physician who performs preventive \nmedical examinations or, in the absence of such request, the physician providing \nhealth care to this person gives their approval.  \n\u00a7 41 \nAt the University,  a Saturday is  a holiday day resulting from an average five -day working \nweek system . \n\u00a7 42 \n1. The settlement period for the working time of non -academic staff is one month, i.e. from \n0:00 on the first day of the month to 12:00 p.m. on the last day of the month. If the \nemployee works a t night on the first or last day of the settlement period, their working \ntime on a shift is to be allocated accordingly to the respective settlement periods.  \n2. In particularly justified cases, at the request of the director of an organisational unit, the \nRector, in agreement with the unions, may extend the settlement period up to 3 months, \nand in the case of a basic or task -based  working time system  up to 4 months.  \n3. The possibility of extending the settlement period beyond one mont h does not apply to \nthe working time system  referred to in \u00a7 61, 66 , and 67.  \n4. The settlement period for the working time of academic teachers is set out in \u00a747(4).  \n\u00a7 43 \n1. Work in excess of the working time standards applicable to the employee  as well as work \nperformed in excess of the extended  daily working time resulting from the working time \nsystem  and schedule applicable to the employee  constitute overtime work.  \n2. Weekly working time, including overtime, must not exceed an average of 48 hours in any \ngiven settlement period.  \n3. The number of overtime hours may not exceed 150 hours per calendar year for \nan individual employee.  \n4. Work performed by a part -time employee in excess of the agreed number of hours  \u2013 if it \ndoes not exceed the working time standard of 0.9 f ull-time equivalent  \u2013 does not \nconstitute overtime. This constitutes work over standard working time, for which normal \nremuneration is paid.  \n5. Apart from the regular remuneration, part -time employees are entitled to an additional \novertime remuneration for th e work performed in excess of the working time  of 0.9 full -\ntime equivalent . \n\u00a7 44 \n1. For the purpose of settling the employee's working time and related entitlements, the \nfollowing terms are hereby defined:  \n1) a day  \u2013 this means consecutive 24 hours, starting from the hour when the employee \nstarts work according to the applicable working time schedule;  \n2) a week  \u2013 this means 7 consecutive calendar days, starting from the first day of the \nsettlement period;  \n3) work in shifts  \u2013 this means any form of shift work whereby employees alternate \nbetween the same work stations  according to a certain schedule, including a system \nof succession, which may be continuous or interrupted  and entail the necessity for \nemployees t o perform work at different times over a period of days or weeks;  \n4) night-time \u2013 the hours between 11:00 p.m . and 7:00 a.m. the following day;  \n5) work on Sunday or public holiday  \u2013 this means work from 7:00 a.m. on Sunday or \npublic holiday until 7:00 a.m. on th e following day;  \n6) shift employee  \u2013 this means an employee whose work schedule is part of work in \n\nPage 24 of 56 \n shifts.  \n\u00a7 45 \n1. Subject to the provisions of the Labour Code, employees are entitled to:  \n1) at least 11 hours of uninterrupted rest (daily rest) per day;  \n2) at least 35 hours of uninterrupted rest each week, including at least 11 hours of \nuninterrupted daily rest (weekly rest).  \n2. The weekly rest should fall on a Sunday. Any Sunday is 24 consecutive hours, beginning \nat 7:00 a.m. on a Sunday.  \n3. In cases where the employee carries out authorised work on a Sunday, the weekly rest \nmay fall on a day other than a Sunday.  \n4. An employee who works on Sundays must have at least one Sunday off every 4 weeks . \n\u00a7 46 \n1. If the daily working time of the employee:  \n1) is at least 6 hours,  the employee is entitled to a break of 15 minutes,  \n2) is longer than 9 hours, the employee is entitled to an additional break of 15 minutes,  \n3) is longer than 16 hours, the employee is entitled to another break of at least 15 \nminutes counted into working time.  \n2. Employees with severe and moderate disabilities are entitled to an additional 15-minute \nbreak included in their working time for physical exercise or rest.  \n3. After each hour of uninterrupted work in front of a computer screen, employees working \nwith screen monitors are entitled to a break of 5 minutes included in their working time.  \nChapter II  \nWorking Time and Ru les for Assigning and Carrying O ut Teaching Duties  \nby Academic Staff  \nWorking Time System  \u2013 Implementation and Allocation  \n\u00a7 47 \n1. Academic teachers work in a task -based  working time system , in accordance with the \npreceding items.  \n2. Teaching activities and organisational work for the University is carried out by academic \nteachers at the time and place designated by the employer.  \n2a. An academic teacher may be assigned with working on Sundays and public holidays, if \nsuch a necessity arises from teaching activities as well as research and organisational \nduties.  \n3. The working time of academic teachers related to teaching must be recorded.  \n4. The settleme nt period for the working time of academic teachers is 12 months and covers \nthe period from 1 October of a given year to 30 September of the following year.  \n\u00a7 48 \n1. The allocation of working time for academic teachers is as follows:  \n1) research and teaching staf f: \na) work associated with the education and forming of students or participation in the \neducation of doctoral candidates and work associated with improving teaching \ncompetence  \u2013 45%;  \nb) work associated with carrying out scientific activities and work associated  with \nimproving professional competence other than that referred to in point (a)  \u2013 45 %;  \nc) organisational work for the University  \u2013 10 %;  \n\nPage 25 of 56 \n 2) teaching staff:  \na) work related to the education and forming of students or participation in education \nof doctoral candidat es, and work related to improving professional \ncompetence  \u2013 80%;  \nb) organisational work for the University  \u2013 20 %;  \n3) research staff: \na) work associated with scientific activity or participation in education of doctoral \ncandidates, and work associated  with improvin g professional competence  \u2013 90 %;  \nb) organisational work for the University  \u2013 10 %.  \n2. In specific cases, in particular in connection with the accomplishment of important \nresearch or teaching tasks, or important tasks of the University, the Rector may set \na different allocation of working time for academic teachers than that set out in item 1.  \nForms of Teaching  \n\u00a7 49 \n1. Academic teachers employed at the University may teach the courses specified in the \nAGH University  Studies Regulations and in doctoral studies an d the doctoral school, \nexcept that:  \n1) foreign language classes  may be taught by academic teachers employed at the AGH \nUniversity  as assistant professors  (adiunkt ), senior language instructors  (starszy \nlektor ), or language instructors  with appropriate qualifications to conduct such classes;  \n2) physical education classes may be conducted by academic teachers employed at the \nAGH University as assistant professor s, senior instructor s, or instructor s with \nappropriate qualifications to conduct such classes;  \n3) lectures may be given only by an academic teacher having at least an academic \ndegree.  \n2. The diploma theses are supervised by an authorised academic teacher. In justified cases \nresulting in particular from the specificity of the subject of the diploma project, t he Dean \nof a Faculty may consent to the preparation of the diploma thesis under the direction of \nanother person, who has the competences and experience that allow the diploma thesis \nto be properly completed.  \n3. Academic teachers, with the consent of the Dean of a Faculty, may also teach in other \norganisational units of the University.  \nTeaching Load  \n\u00a7 50 \n1. A teaching load is defined as the annual required number of hours (in a given academic \nyear) taught by the academic teacher resulting from employment at  the AGH University  \non a given position, as referred to in section 4.  \n2. One teaching hour (calculation hour) is 45 minutes.  \n3. Academic teachers must fully comply with the teaching load determined for them and \nset out  in calculated hours.  \n4. The annual teaching load per position for full -time academic teachers is as follows:  \nposition  research and teaching  teaching  \nProfessor  180 teaching hours  270 teaching hours  \nAssociate  professor  210 teaching hours  315 teaching hours  \nAssistant professor  240 teaching hours  360 teaching hours  \nAssistant  240 teaching hours  360 teaching hours  \n\nPage 26 of 56 \n Senior language \ninstructor  x 360 teaching hours  \nSenior instructor  x 360 teaching hours  \nLanguage instructor  x 540 teaching hours  \nInstructor  x 540 teaching hours  \nThe teaching load is determined according to the position held (in a given group, i.e. \nresearch and teaching or teaching staff) on 1 October of the academic year in question \nor on the date of employment if the employment took place after the beginning of \nan academic ye ar. \nA change of a position (in a given group) during an academic year does not change the  \nteaching  load. A change of the group during an academic year results in a change of the \nteaching load. \n5. Academic teachers working part -time are subject to the teaching  load referred to in item \n4 in proportion to their full -time position.  \n6. If it is not possible for academic teachers to complete the teaching load within the scope  \nreferred to in item 4, including the additional hours referred to in \u00a7 52, the dean of \na faculty may assign and settle the  teaching load smaller than the teaching load specified \nin item 4. In this case, the percentage allocation of working time of such academic \nteachers as concerns their research and organisational duties, as referred to in \u00a7 48, i s \nincreased proportiona lly. \n7. Assigning and calculating hours in a number smaller than the teaching load specified in \nitem 4 is permissible only in exceptional cases, which  are, in particular , justified by \na decreasing number of students, while  maintaining a  balanced workload for all academic \nteachers working in a given unit (faculty or department).  \n8. The number of teaching hours smaller than the teaching load specified in item 4 may not \nexceed 45 hours.  \n9. In the case of an  academic teacher for whom no teaching h ours have been assigned \nbecause:  \n1) they were employed after the start of an academic year;  \n2) of their foreseeable absence from work, in particular , due to a research leave, long -\nterm illness, health leave, unpaid leave , or other leave from work, military servi ce, \nmaternity leave, leave under the conditions of a maternity leave, paternity leave, \nparental leave;  \n3) of the termination of their employment before the end of an academic year  \n- one thirtieth of the annual teaching load determined for a given position for  each \nweek of absence in the period during which classes are taught a t the University is \nincluded  into the number of hours  they have worked  for. \nReduction in the Teaching Load  \n\u00a7 51 \n1. The reduction in the teaching load referred to in \u00a7 50(4) due to a function  performed at \nthe University is as follows:  \nFunction  number of hours by which \nthe load is reduced  \nRector  150 teaching hours  \nVice-Rector  105 teaching hours  \n\nPage 27 of 56 \n Dean of a Faculty  90 teaching hours  \nDirector of a Research C entre  90 teaching hours  \nDirector of the Doctoral School  90 teaching hours  \nChairperson of a Scientific Discipline Council  60 teaching hours  \nDirector of a T eachi ng Centre  60 teaching hours  \nVice-Dean 60 teaching hours  \nDeputy Director of a Research C entre  45 teaching hours  \nDeputy Director of the Doctoral School  45 teaching hours  \nDeputy Chairperson of a Scientific Discipline Council  30 teaching hours  \nDeputy Director of a Teaching C entre  30 teaching hours  \nDirector of an I nstitute  45 teaching hours  \nHead of a D epartment  30 teaching hours  \nRector's Proxy for Quality of Education  45 teaching hours  \nMember of the U niversity  Team for Teaching Audit  45 teaching hours  \nDean\u2019s Proxies  for Quality of Education  30 teaching hours  \n \n2. The reduction of the te aching load referred to in \u00a7 50( 4) is also possible:  \n1) where academic teachers are assigned important tasks or where they carry out \nresearch projects or other tasks set out  in the Statute ; \n2) in special cases justified by the interests o f the University.  \n3. The teaching load reductions referred to in item 2 are granted by the Rector at the request \nof the academic teacher and approved by the dean of a faculty.  \n4. A reduction in the teaching load for leading a research project depends on the importance \nof the proj ect and must not be  more than 45 hours.  \n5. In the case of reimbursement for a part of the academic teacher's remuneration from \na research project (or any other source related to the conduct of research), the reduction \nof the load must be directly proportional  to the reimbursed part of the remuneration. The \nreduction may not exceed half of the full -time teaching load referred to in \u00a7 50(4).  \n6. A reduction in the teaching load is permitted for one reason only and for one academic \nyear only.  \n7. At the request of an aca demic teacher holding a certificate of moderate or severe \ndisability, whose maximal working hours are determined pursuant to \u00a7 40  a(2), the \nRector shall reduce the teaching load in proportion to the reduction of the maximum  \nworking hours, i.e. 1/8 of the teaching load. A reduction of the teaching load amounting \n\nPage 28 of 56 \n to less than an hour shall be rounded in such a way that a reduction below half an hour \nshall be disregarded, and a  reduction above half an hour shall be counted as a  whole  \nhour.  \n8. Apart from the reduction of the teaching load referred to in item 7, the academic teacher \nmay have their teaching load reduced also due to one other reason.  \n9. The reduction of the teaching load referred to in item 7 may be granted for a period n o \nlonger than one academic year.  \n10. The employment at the AGH University which in total exceed s the full -time hours (1,0) \nmay not constitute a basis for the reduction of the teaching load.  \nHours Included in the Teaching Load of an Academic Teacher  \n\u00a7 52 \n1. An academic teacher's teaching load include s all calculated hours for teaching \nassignments referred to in \u00a749(1) ( the so-called \u201clive hours\u201d) and the additional hours \nreferred to in items 1a and 2.  \n1a. In the case of classes taught in a congressional language, the number of additional hours \nis determined using the following formula: number of additional hours = M x 0.3 where \nM \u2013 number of hours of classes taught in a congressional language.  \n2. The dean of a faculty, after having consulted with a faculty college, determines the \nadditional number of hours included in the teaching load of the academic teacher in an \nacademic year on the account of:  \n1) the supervision over:  \na) (in the version applicable until  30 September 2023)  \na diploma thesis, after it has been submitted and registered in a dean\u2019s  office, in \na number of no more than 12 theses per cycle of st udies with their distribution \namong academic teachers being as even as possible:  \n- up to 10 hours  \u2013 per diploma thesis in engineering studies or studies that are \nconcluded with the conferring of the title of licencjat  and up to 15 hours in the \ncase of team theses;  \n- up to 15 hours  \u2013 per diploma thesis in studies that are concluded with the \nconferring of the ti tle of magister  and up to 30  hours in the case of team theses;  \na) (in the version applicable from 1 October 2023)  \na diploma project or thesis (started in the same academic year), after it has been \nsubmitted and registered according to the provisions of the  AGH University Study \nRegulations, in a number determined below:  \n \nin the academic year \n2023/2024  19 diploma projects or theses, including no more \nthan 9 in second -cycle degree programmes  \nin the academic year \n2024/2025  14 diploma projects or theses, including no more \nthan 6 in second -cycle degree programmes  \nfrom the academic year \n2025/2026  10 diploma projects or theses, including no more \nthan 4 in second -cycle degree programmes  \nwith the ir distribution among academic teach ers being as even as possible:   \n- up to 10 hours  \u2013 per thesis in first -cycle degree programmes and up to 15 hours \nin the case of team theses;  \n- up to 15 hours  \u2013 per thesis in second -cycle degree programmes and up to 30 \nhours in the case of team theses;  \nb) a doctoral candidate:  \n- in doctoral studies \u2013 up to 15 hours/year prior to the beginning of  the doctoral \ndissertation procedure and up to 30 hours/year after the doctoral dissertation \n\nPage 29 of 56 \n procedure has started, but no later than one year after completing studies;  \n- in the doctoral school  \u2013 up to 15 hours/year until obtaining a positive mid -term \ngrade (Chapter X of th e Doctoral Studies Regulations)  and up to 30 hours/year \nafter a positive mid -term grade has been obtained, but no later than after one \nyear after complet ing the doctoral school;  \nc) a student studying under an individual study organisation  \u2013 up to 10 \nhours/semester;  \nd) an academic club  \u2013 up to 45 hours/year, depending on the documented activity of \nthe club, after the dean of a faculty has approved the report;  \ne) a student, trainee , or scholarship holder under national or international \nprogramme s \u2013 up to 10 hours/semester.  \n2) conducting examinations, using the following formula:  \nNumber of additional hours  = k * N when  N> N min \nwhere:  \nN \u2013 number of students examined;  \nK \u2013 coefficient selected by the dean after having consulted with the faculty college; \nthe coefficient is selected from the following set: [0; 0,05; 0,1; 0,15; 0,2; \n0,25; 0,3]. The dean, after having consulted with the faculty college, may \ndecide to vary thi s coefficient for oral and written examinations; in this case, \nit is recommended that the coefficient for oral examinations be greater than \nfor written examinations;  \nNmin \u2013 the minimum number of students taking examinations, set by the dean after \nhaving consulted with the faculty college, above which the dean may set the \nnumber of additional hours for conducting the examination.  \nThe total number of additional hours for conducting examinations may not exceed 60 \nhours/year for a given acade mic teacher.  \n2a. (applicable from 1 October 2023)  \nThe teaching load of an academic teacher who has a status of the AGH University tutor \nalso includes the hours for educating by means of tutoring:  \n1) within development and science tutoring \u2013 15 hours a se mester for one student,  \n2) within course tutoring \u2013 15 hours a semester for up to three students.  \n3. Academic teachers are entitled to additional remuneration for managing and/or \nsupervising student internship s according to separate provisions. Teaching h ours of \nclasses conducted as part of supervision over student internship s are not to be included \nin the teaching load.  \n4. Decisions whether to include additional hours referred to in item 2 into the academic \nteacher's teaching load are made by the dean of a faculty, according to the rule that \nacademic teachers are required to meet their teaching loads, at least half of which must \nbe met through the teaching assignments referred to in \u00a749(1) ( i.e. the so called \u201clive \nhours\u201d).  \n5. The financial consequences of the  decisions referred to in item 4 should be balanced in \nfaculties\u2019 budgets and funded with faculties\u2019 own revenue.  \n6. The teaching load of academic teachers of the Department of Foreign Languages may \ninclude language classes for students participating in international exchange programmes \nas well as Polish language classes organised at the University and mandated  by the \nRector.  \n7. During illness or other unforeseen  but justified absence of the academic  teacher, \nincluding when classes are cancelled  by the Rector or the dean of a faculty, the teaching \nhours calculated as part of the teaching load which, according to the course schedule, \nwould have been taught during such absence, for the purpose of determ ining the number \n\nPage 30 of 56 \n of teaching hours , are to be considered hours for which the academic teacher has worked \naccording to the schedule.  \nOrder of Settling Hours  \n\u00a7 53 \n1. Calculated hours are inc luded in the teaching load of the  academic teacher in the following \norder:  \n1) hours for teaching classes in the full-time first -cycle and second -cycle studies as well \nas classes for doctoral candidates referred to in \u00a7 49(1) (the so -called \u201clive hours \u201d); \n2) additional hours for full -time studies as referred to in \u00a7 52(2);  \n3) hours for teaching and additional hours taught in part -time studies.  \n2. The hours included in the teaching load of academic teachers in  the part-time first -cycle \nand part -time second -cycle studies, as well as classes for doc toral students, must be \nrefinanced from tuition fees paid by students or doctoral candidates.  \nTeaching Classes in Overtime Hours  \n\u00a7 54 \n1. Overtime hours are hours that result from the number of the assigned and actually taught \nteaching hours over the teaching load actually taught, whereas the number of hours of \nthe load is determined for a given position according to \u00a7  50 in a given academic year.  \n2. If no overtime hours are scheduled in the teaching load plan and the academic teacher \nbenefits from the reductions referred to in \u00a7  51, the number of the teaching hours over \nthe number of the reduction does not constitute overtime hours and is to be considered \nthe number of hours taught in accordance with the teaching load  determined for a given \nposition pursuant to \u00a7  50. \n3. Hours credited on account of an absence of the academic teacher referred to in \u00a7 50( 9)(2) \nand \u00a7 52(7) cannot be used as the basis to calculate the number of overtime hours. In \nsuch cases, the number of ove rtime hours for which the academic teacher is entitled to \nadditional remuneration, determined based on the number of hours taught over the \nteaching load determined for a given position pursuant to \u00a750 in a given academic year, \nis to be reduced by the numbe r of hours credited on account of such absence.  \n4. Academic teachers who benefit from the reduction in the teaching load referred to in \u00a7  51 \nand to whom \u00a7  50(6 to 8) applies are entitled to remuneration for overtime hours only \nfor courses in excess of the tea ching load determined for a given position pursuant to \n\u00a7 50. \n5. The academic teacher \u2019 remuneration for overtime hours is determined according to  \nseparate provisions.  \n6. Remuneration for overtime work is determined by using the highest rate for a given \nposition applicable in the period which the settlement of the teaching load concerns, \nsubject to item 7.  \n7. In the event of a change of position during an academic year, the remuneration for \novertime work is determined based on the teaching schedule and using the rates  that \napply to the position in question as at the day on which the classes were actually taught.  \n8. The rate for overtime hours for specific classes is set by the dean of a faculty after having \nconsulted with the faculty college.  \n9. Remuneration for overtime wor k is awarded after having settled the number of hours of \nteaching, determined in accordance with the schedule and pursuant to \u00a7 5(9) and \u00a752(7) \nof the Work Regulations, once a year, in the period specified in \u00a7 6(3) of the Regulations \ngoverning the Remuner ation of AGH University  Employees, after submitting a complete \nand correct report from a given faculty.  \n10. In special cases, justified by the need to implement a study programme, academic \n\nPage 31 of 56 \n teachers may be required to teach courses in overtime hours, for a number of hours \nthat is no larger than (i ) \u00bc, \u2013 for members of research and teaching staff, and (ii) \u00bd \nfor members of teaching staff  \u2013 of the teaching load determined for a given position \naccording to \u00a7 50, and in the case of employment of the academic tea cher during an \nacademic year or in the case of termination of employment relationship before the end \nof an academic year, or in the case of part -time employment  \u2013 for a number of hours \nthat is no larger than the teaching load prescribed for such a teacher in the year in \nquestion.  \n11. Academic teachers may be assigned to teach in excess of the number of overtime hours \nspecified in item 10 if they  consent to  such assignment  at their sole discretion  by \na written statement.  \n12. No academic teacher who is pregnant or w ho is raising a child up to the age of four may \nbe employed overtime without their consent . \n13. The maximum permissible number of overtime hours for full -time teachers is 70% of \nthe teaching load determined pursuant to \u00a7  50 for a given position as concerns \ncalculation hours for teaching activities referred to in \u00a7  49 (1) (the so -called \u201clive \nhours \u201d), but no more than 100%. The maximum permissible number of overtime hours \nreferred to in the first sentence does not include the hours referred to in \u00a7 52(2)(1)(a ) \n(i.e. for supervising a thesis).  \n14. The dean of a faculty (director of a teaching centre) may reduce the permitted number \nof overtime hours referred to in item 13.  \n15. In the case of employment of the academic teacher  after the beginning of an academic \nyear or the termination of the employment relationship before the end of an academic \nyear, the maximum permissible number of overtime hours is determined on the basis \nof the teaching load assigned to the  teacher in the academic year.  \n16. At the request of the dean of a faculty ( or the director of a teaching centre), the Rector \nmay approve overtime teaching by a part -time academic teacher  of up to 50% of their \nnormal teaching load.  \n17. If other academic teachers at a unit fail to comply with their teaching loads, the \nacadem ic teacher may not be assigned overtime teaching hours.  \nSpecific Organisation and Procedure  for Settling Teaching Hours and the Size of \nStudent Groups  \n\u00a7 55 \nThe Rector determines the organisation and the procedure for settling teaching activities \nat faculties and at non -faculty units by way of the Rector's order.  \nChapter III  \nWorking Time of Non -Academic Staff  \n\u00a7 56 \n1. Non-academic staff work under the following working time systems : \n1) basic; \n2) equivalent;  \n3) task-based ; \n4) shortened working week;  \n5) weekend.  \n2. The follo wing working time schedules may be used in each working time system : \n1) flexible ; \n2) individual.  \n\nPage 32 of 56 \n 3. Work in shifts is permitted in each working time system . \n4. The employer  \u2013 as part of their rights associated with managing and directing the \nworkplace and with organising the work process at the workplace  \u2013 is entitled to \ndetermine the working time system  and working time schedule for a given employee; \nthe employe e must work according to that system  and schedule. Subject to item 5, \na change of the working time system  according to which the employee works does not \nrequire an amendment to the employment contract or the regulations. The change of \nthe working time system and the working time schedule must be made in writing, at \nleast 7 days before the start of the next settlement period.  \n5. The application of the working time systems referred to in item 1(4 and 5) is made \nunder the employment contract  at the employee's req uest. \n6. For employees whose working time is governed by separate provisions, the working \ntime is determined by the Rector at the request of the director of an organisational unit.  \nBasic  System  \n\u00a7 57 \n1. Non-academic staff work unde r the basic working time system  i.e. 8 hours per day and \n40 hours per week. The employees work between 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday \nthrough Frida y, subject to section 2 and \u00a7 68 and \u00a7 69  of these regulations. Work in \nexcess of 8 hours per day constitutes overtime.  \n2. If is justified by the teaching, research , or organisational needs of the University, the \ndirector of an organisational unit may schedule the employee's working time differently. \nIn such a case, the total number of days off work in the adopted settlement period must \ncorrespo nd at least to the number of Sundays, holidays , and days off work in an average \nfive-day working week of that period.  \n\u00a7 58 \n1. Members of part -time staff work from Monday to Friday with an equal and proportionate \nnumber of hours. The starting time of work is determined by the director of an \norganisational unit, who must take into account the requests of employees.  \n2. Part-time employ ees may work under an  individual working time schedule th at does not \nnecessarily include  all working days of the week or an equal number of hours of work on \neach day.  \n3. In the cases referred to in item 2, working time schedules are determined by the director  \nof an organisational unit under individual timetables which must cover at least one \nmonth; in doing so, the director must take into account employees\u2019 requests.  \n4. The individual employees\u2019 timetables referred to in item 3 must be forwarded to the unit \nrespo nsible for personnel matters.  \nEquivalent System  \n\u00a7 59 \n1. If justified by the nature of the work and its organisation, the equivalent working time \nsystem  may be applied.  \n2. In justified cases, the equivalent working time system  may be introduced by the Rector  \nat the request of the director of an organisational unit.  \n3. (deleted)  \n4. (deleted)  \n5. Working time schedules for employees working in the equivalent working time system  is \ndetermined by the director of an organisational unit in individual work timetables that \ncover at least one month. The timetable is communicated to the employee at least 7 days \nbefore the beginning of the month the relevant timetable concerns.  \n\nPage 33 of 56 \n 6. The timetable referred to in item 5 must be forwarded to the unit responsible for \npersonnel  matters . \n\u00a7 60 \n1. For employees employed in the guarding of property or protection of persons (in \nparticular  doorkeepers , guards, receptionists, property protection inspectors, etc.), \na system of equivalent working time is implemented, in which it is permissible to extend  \nthe daily working time, but not more than by 12 hours, in a settlement period not \nexceeding 1 month. The extended daily working time is balanced by a shorter daily \nworking time on certain days or by  way of granting  days off.  \n2. The basic working time schedul e for security guards is 12 working hours; working hours \nfrom 7 a .m. to 7 p .m. or from 7 p .m. to 7 a .m. the following day.  \n3. If justified by organisational needs, the director of an organisational unit may set \na different working time schedule for the employ ee. \n4. In the working time schedule referred to in item 3 ( flexible  working schedule), repeated \nwork during the same day does not constitute overtime.  \n\u00a7 61 \nIn the case of work that involves supervision of equipment or work that involves a partial \nstandby duty , the equivalent working time system  may be used, where it is permissible to \nextend the daily working time, but for no more than 16 hours in a settlement period no \nlonger than one month. In this working time system  the employee is entitled, immediately \nas of the end of each period of work in the extended daily working time, to rest for a time \ncorresponding to at least the number of hours they have worked for, irrespective of the \nweekly rest.  \n\u00a7 62 \nFor employees emplo yed at the AGH University  Swimming Pool, the equivalent working time \nsystem  is introduced for particular employee groups (as may become necessary); under the \nsystem  it is possible to extend the daily working time, but by no more than 12 hours, in a \nsettlem ent period no longer than one month. The extended daily working time is balanced \nby a shorter daily working time on certain days or by  granting  days off.  \n\u00a7 63 \n1. For library emplo yees, it is possible to apply  the flexible  working time schedule in the \nequivalent working time system ; under the schedule, daily working hours may be \nextended, but by no more than 12 hours, in a settlement period no longer than 1 month.  \n2. Work begins between 6:30 a .m. and 1:00 p .m. and ends between  1:30 p .m. and 8:00 \np.m. \n3. Individual decisions on working time schedules are made by the director of an \norganisational unit.  \n4. The application of the flexible  working time schedule may not, in particular, violate the \nprovisions on daily and weekly rest and ma y not lead to overtime hours. Repeated work \nduring the same day does not constitute overtime.  \n\u00a7 64 \nFor employees employed at the AGH University  \u201cSienkiewicz\u00f3wka\u201d Guest House, the \nequivalent working time system  is introduced; under the system  it is possible to extend the \ndaily working time, but by no more than 12 hours, in a settlement period no longer than \none month. The extended daily working time is balanced by a shorter daily working time on \ncertain days or by  granting  days off.  \nTask -Based  System  \n\u00a7 65 \n1. In cases justified by the type of work or its organisation or the workplace, the Rector, at \n\nPage 34 of 56 \n the request of the director of an organisational unit, may introduce a task -based  working \ntime system . \n2. The task -based  working time system  may be used , in particular , in organisational units \nand with regard to positions where it is not possible or reasonable to determine in \nadvance the time and place of work or permanent duties performed on a regular basis in \nan organised manner, as well as in cases wher e the performance of assigned tasks does \nnot require working at the workplace.  \n3. The employer, in consultation with the employee, determines the time necessary to \nperform the assigned tasks, while taking into account the length of working time resulting \nfrom the standards set out in \u00a7 40(2) of these regulations.  \nShortened Working Week System  \n\u00a7 66 \n1. If requested in writing by the employee, the shortened working week system  may be \napplied to them. In this system , it is permissible for the employee to work for fewer  than \n5 days during the week, with the simultaneous extension of the daily working time, but \nby no more than 12 hours, in a settlement period no longer than one month.  \n2. (deleted)  \nWeekend Working System  \n\u00a7 67 \n1. If requested in writing by the employee, the weekend working time system  may be \napplied to them, where the employee works on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays , and on \nholidays. In this system, it is permissible to extend the daily working time, although  by \nno more than 12 hours, in a settlement period no longer than on e month.  \n2. (deleted)  \nFlexible  Working Time  Schedule  \n\u00a7 68 \n1. A working time schedule may set out  different starting times on days which, according to \nthe schedule, are working days for the employees.  \n2. In cases justified by the teaching, research , or organisational needs of the University, \nthe time of starting and finishing work may be individually determined for the employee \nby the director of an organisational unit.  \n3. A flexible  working time schedule may also be introduced at the written request of  the \nemployee.  \n4. A working time schedule may set out  a period within which the employee decides the \ntime when they start work on a day which, according to the schedule, is a working day \nfor the employee.  \n5. In the working time schedules referred to in items 2 t o 4, repeated performance of work \nduring the same day does not constitute overtime.  \nIndividual Working Time Schedule  \n\u00a7 69 \nAt the written request of the employee, the director of an organisational unit may establish \nan individual working time schedule withi n the working time system  that applies to the \nemployee.  \nParticular protection  \n\u00a7 69a \nIn the equivalent system , continuous working system , shortened working week system , \nweekend working system , the working time of:  \n\nPage 35 of 56 \n 1) employees in workplaces where the maximum permissible concentrations and \nintensities of factors harmful to health are exceeded,  \n2) pregnant employees,  \n3) employees caring for a child under four years of age, without the employee's consent,  \n\u2013 shall not exceed 8 hours.

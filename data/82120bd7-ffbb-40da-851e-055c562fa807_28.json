Numerous projects were developed that considered, among other things, the creation of an independent mining academy or a faculty of mining at the Lviv Polytechnic or the Technical Institute in Krakow.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a group of prominent engineers and mining activists, led by Jan Zara\u0144ski, went to great lengths to obtain approval for establishing a higher education institution in Krakow to educate mining engineers. Concentrated diplomatic action was taken in Vienna to win the favour of the Austrian government.\n\nThese efforts were successful, and on July 10, 1912, Krakow authorities received a permit to establish a mining academy.\n\nTime line:\n\n1913\n \u2013 establishment of Mining Academy\n\n1919\n \u2013 opening of the university\n\n1923\n \u2013 the cornerstone for the future university building was laid\n\n1935\n \u2013 the monuments of miners and steelworkers were unveiled in front of the main building of the academy\n\n1939 \u2013 1945\n \u2013 the main building of the Academy was occupied by the German General Government\n\n1945\n \u2013 Mining Academy in Krakow was the only organised technical university in the country\n\n1969\n \u2013 The Academy of Mining and Metallurgy received the name of Stanis\u0142aw Staszic\n\nMore information about the history of AGH University", "metadata": {"url": "https://wtp.agh.edu.pl/history-and-traditions/", "title": "History and traditions \u2013 Welcome Point", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "65f1c344d46865ea019f978a48abe893", "word_count": 247, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "History and traditions"}]}}

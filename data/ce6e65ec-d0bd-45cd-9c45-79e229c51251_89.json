Now, imagine that when the moment comes, you are a recognized expert in the space sector. Make that dream a goal by choosing the Space Technologies Master\u2019s Degree Program at AGH University of Krakow. \n\nNew Master\u2019s Program \u2013 Space Technologies\u00a0\n\nThe AGH University of Krakow is thrilled to announce the launch of a new Master\u2019s program in Space Technologies. This program, which is entirely taught in English, prepares students for careers in one of the fastest-growing industries of the future. It is the first program of its kind in this part of Poland!\u00a0\n\nThree specializations to choose from\u00a0\n\nChoose one of three distinct paths:\u00a0\n\nUpstream \u2013 Designing and building space technologies\u00a0\n\nDownstream \u2013 Analyzing and utilizing data from space missions\u00a0\n\nBiomedical \u2013 Space medicine and life support technologies\u00a0\n\nUpstream\u00a0\n\nFocuses on the technologies and systems used in spacecraft design, construction, and operation. Students will learn about orbital mechanics, spacecraft engineering, and onboard systems, gaining the skills necessary to work on the development and testing of space technologies.\u00a0\n\nDownstream\u00a0\n\nThis program concentrates on processing and analyzing data from space missions. The curriculum includes signal processing, remote sensing, and space imagery analysis, as well as the use of machine learning in space applications. Graduates of this program will be prepared to manage and analyze space data.\u00a0\n\nBiomedical\u00a0\n\nDedicated to those interested in the impact of space on human health and life support technologies in space environments. The program covers space biology, medicine, and biomedical engineering, preparing students to work on life-support systems in space.\u00a0\n\nBeyond studies \u2013 industry partnerships from day one\u00a0\n\nThe program offers expertise and internships with tech and space companies, including \nCloudFerro\n, \nIntel\n or \nCreotech Instruments\n, with more partners joining. This close collaboration between academia and industry ensures that students gain a clear perspective on their career paths from the start. Practical experience acquired during the program will make entering the job market more straightforward.\u00a0\n\nA global environment \u2013 Just like the space industry\u00a0\n\nThe space sector is inherently global, and pursuing a career in this field means embracing work in an international environment.

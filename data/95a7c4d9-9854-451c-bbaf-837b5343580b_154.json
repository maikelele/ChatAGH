At present, he is the manager of the Research Group of Magnetic Bulk- and Nanomaterials in the Department of Solid State Physics.\n\nHe is a member of the Polish Physical Society (on the Krakow Board in 2008\u20132014), the European Physical Society (on the Condensed Matter Division Board in 2005\u20132012), and Societas Humboldtiana Polonorum (head of the Krakow and Katowice branch in 2005\u20132008). In 1990/91, he was a Humboldt Fellow at the University of Bochum, in 1995/96 a Leverhulme Trust Fellow at the University of St. Andrews, UK, and in 1993\u20131995 and 1997\u20132005 a multiple EPSRC Fellow at the aforementioned university.\n\nHe was honoured with the Minister\u2019s third degree award for achievements in scientific activity, multiple Awards of the AGH University Rector for scientific and research activity (more than 20 times), the Award of the AGH University Rector for organisational activity (three times), and the title of Honorary Professor from the University of St. Andrews, UK (2000).\n\nProfessor Czes\u0142aw Kapusta was honoured with the Order of Polonia Restituta, the Knight\u2019s Cross of Polonia Restituta, the Cross of Merit, and the Medal of the Commission of National Education.\n\nAward for significant achievements in scientific activities for the team of: Professor Krzysztof Wojciechowski, Dr Taras Parashchuk, Dr Karolina Zazakowny, Dr Artur Kosonowski, Dr Oleksandr Cherniushok, Dr Ryszard Mania, Dr Micha\u0142 Musia\u0142, Dr Marcin Borcuch,\u00a0 Adrianna Lis, MSc, Maja Sajdak, MSc, Mykola Maksymuk, MSc (Engineering and technology)\n\nThe team headed by Professor Krzysztof Wojciechowski from the Thermoelectric Research Laboratory at the Faculty of Materials Science and Ceramics was recognised for the development of globally innovative technologies for the production of thermoelectric materials and modules for the conversion of low-grade heat.\n\nThe basis for this achievement are two prestigious projects concluded in 2022, which were headed by Professor Krzysztof Wojciechowski:\n\n\u201cNew approach for development of efficient materials for direct conversion of heat into electricity\u201d, financed by the Foundation for Polish Science, 2018\u20132022 (TEAM-TECH/2016\u20132/14),\n\nTERMOD project on the development of a manufacturing technology for a new type of thermoelectric module to convert low-grade waste heat into electricity, financed by the National Centre for Research and Development, 2019\u20132022 (TECHMATSTRATEG2/408569/5/NCBR/2019).\n\nAs a result of the project work, the correctness of innovative research hypotheses was confirmed both in theory and in practice. The newly-obtained thermoelectric materials have heat to energy conversion efficiency at 17%, which is one of the highest values reported in the world.\n\nThe technology developed at the AGH University allows to produce thermoelectric converters with high power density of 3.2 kW/m\n2\n, with material costs comparable to the manufacturing costs of photovoltaic elements of a similar size.\n\nThe work on the implementation of both projects have brought additional results, including:\n\n29 publications in prestigious journals on the JCR list;\n\neight patent applications and Polish and European patents;\n\nfour defended doctoral theses and three on-going ones related to the implementation of the projects\u2019 topics;\n\nR&D project cooperation with five companies;\n\nnew international project \u2013 MAITEG, WEAVE-UNISONO 2022/04/Y/ST5/00139 with German Aerospace Institute (DLR) and University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE);\n\ntwo more international projects: IMPRESS-U and M-ERANET (under review).\n\nA significant part of research results has been patented or the patents are pending. Results of both R&D projects have been disseminated in journals, at international conference, in press and on social media. Contacts have been established with many Polish and foreign industrial partners interested in implementing new thermoelectric technologies developed by the team.\n\nThis year, the following awards were presented: 20 lifetime achievement awards, 33 awards for significant achievements in scientific activities, 4 awards for significant achievements in teaching activities, 6 awards for significant achievements in implementation activities, 2 awards for significant organizational achievements. Altogether, 150 people were honoured by the Minister of Science and Higher Education.\n\nBack", "metadata": {"url": "https://agh.edu.pl/en/news/detail/agh-university-scientists-with-awards-of-the-minister-of-science-and-higher-education", "title": "AGH University scientists with Awards of the Minister of Science and Higher Education-- AGH UST ", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "414316b64d592c49eea3595f9251a91c", "word_count": 1308, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "AGH University scientists with Awards of the Minister of Science and Higher Education"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Other news from this category"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Recent news"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Stopka"}]}}

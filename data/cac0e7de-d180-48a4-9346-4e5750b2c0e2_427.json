We are starting the second century of AGH University of Krakow with ambitious plans to develop advanced space technologies\"\n\nUNIVERSEH\n is a collaborative alliance formed by seven European universities from seven distinct countries, including the AGH University of Krakow. It was established in November 2020 to develop a new way of collaboration in the field of Space within the new \u201cEuropean Universities\u201d initiative promoted by the European Commission. The main goal is to increase the mobility of students and academic staff, as well as to promote interuniversity cooperation.\n\nUNIVERSEH\n\u00a0aims to introduce innovative educational experiences for university stakeholders and the broader society. This initiative embraces a holistic view of space, encompassing traditional areas like physics and engineering and broadening its scope to include cultural, philosophical, and sustainability considerations.\n\nSee the UNIVERSEH website\n\nUniversity of Toulouse\n (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), France\n\u00a0\u2013 project coordinator\n\nAGH University of Krakow\n, Poland\n\nHeinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf \n(Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf), Germany\n\nLule\u00e5 University of Technology\n, Sweden\n\nUniversity of Luxembourg\n, Luxembourg\n\nUniversity\u00a0\u201cTor Vergata\u201d \n(Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata), Italy\n\nUniversity of Namur\n, Belgium\n\nDisclaimer: \nUNIVERSEH is an alliance of seven universities from seven European countries.\n\nFunded by the European Union.

As a result, they have developed natural radioprotective mechanisms. However, in some cases, these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Elevated doses and prolonged exposure to radiation, such as during radiotherapy or in extreme environments like spaceflight, can cause damage to DNA and increase the abundance of reactive oxygen species, which can affect biological processes. In contrast to synthetic ingredients, naturally produced radioprotective materials have good biocompatibility and are easy to recycle. This project investigates the radioprotective properties of the hydrogel biofilm produced by the kombucha microbial consortium.\u00a0 To enhance the radioprotection of kombucha's biofilm, metallic components (K, Fe, Mxenes) and biological additives are tested. Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, which are resistant to oxidative stress, are added to the cultivation media. The chemical composition of the resulting KBC films is measured using the FTIR method. Physical properties are characterized using microscopy, ion leaching, and contact angle measurements. Post-processed dried KBC wristbands are analyzed for absorption parameters to enhance protective shielding. Possible levels of radioprotection for various types of bacterial cellulose thickness and forms are computed based on the obtained results. The findings encourage the use of bacterial cellulose in a circular economy for future bioregenerative processes.\u00a0\n\nContact\n:\u00a0\nakolodziejczyk@agh.edu.pl\n\nKeywords\n:\u00a0biomaterials, bacterial cellulose, sustainable life, plastic alternatives\n\nSelected Publications\n:\n\nKami\u0144ski K, et al.

We have investigated demographic factors such as age, gender, education level, religiosity, political persuasion, etc. We found that the major determinant of space exploration acceptance and support is gender. However, after controlling for prior education in this field and conviction about the importance of space education gender differences diminish. We found almost no differences among two countries namely Poland and USA.\u00a0\n\nWe have also investigated subjects related to space education using novel technologies such as VR. We found there are numerous barriers students experience when participating in space education in VR such as heaviness of the headset, issues among glasses wearing participants or the social anxiety stemming from not being able to observe the surroundings. Most importantly we found that participating in space VR lesson significantly increases intention to engage in space education and also increases female participants\u2019 self-efficacy.\u00a0\n\nIn a different study we wanted to investigate the role of \u2018awe\u2019 in environmental attitudes. We have therefore introduced a VR experience aimed at creating the \u201coverview effect\u201d - observing Earth from space. In this study we found that the \u2018awe\u2019 evoked by the VR experience indeed increases the pro-environmental attitudes among participants. This result has practical potential for increasing students\u2019 pro-environmental collective action engagement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nContact\n: \njpyrkosz@agh.edu.pl\n\nKeywords\n:\u00a0---\n\nSelected Publications\n:\n\nSpace Exploration \u2013 Good, Bad or Both?

Tadeusz Uhl, PhD, DSc, Eng.\n\nResearch Area\n: To meet the growing demand for space exploration, the emerging potential of space robots has received widespread attention. In the field of on-orbit servicing, the development of on-orbit robotic capabilities dedicated to tasks such as satellite servicing, orbital debris removal, and orbital asset construction and maintenance has far-reaching and indispensable implications. This research will fucus on the low earth orbit (LEO<2,000km); the servicing target will be cube satellite which mass around 2~6kg.\u00a0 This study will propose a cable driven continuous arm for On-orbit satellite servicing, since soft robot demonstrated superior capabilities to its conventional counterpart when it came to grabbing uncontrolled CubeSats. The focus of this research is to propose a novel continuous-arm space robot design, dedicated to completing the dual tasks of satellite docking and maintenance through soft robot.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMain Questions / Hypothesis:\n\nHypothesis 1: The SimMechanics (MATLAB Simulink) model, developed using the lumped parameter method, would reduce calculation time and increase calculation efficiency compared to the traditional finite element method (FEM) while maintaining comparable accuracy.\u00a0\n\nHypothesis 2: Under identical conditions the end-effector motion disturbance to the base of the soft robot will be less than that of the rigid robot, indicating a lower joint-to-base coupling factor and better stability\u00a0\n\nHypothesis 3: Using the generalized Jacobian matrix derived from the mathematical model as an observer in the Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller will get less error compared to using dynamic Jacobian inverse and modified simple adaptive control\u00a0\n\nResearch Summary\n:\u00a0\n\nThe initial stages of this research task have been accomplished, including the identification of the research problem and focus area: the utilization of a chaser satellite with an integrated soft robot for capturing target CubeSats.\u00a0\n\nA review of the relevant literature has also been conducted, encompassing studies on satellites, their dynamics, and the principles of soft robotics, discussion of robots\u2019 trajectory.\u00a0\n\nModelling and Simulation of the bending mechanics in the soft robot's structure has been performed. This simulation has allowed for an initial assessment of how the soft robot would deform and react under different conditions.\u00a0\n\nThe calculations have been carried out to determine the kinematic and dynamic properties, both forward and inverse, of the soft robot's 2 to 5 segments configurations.\u00a0\n\nA new predictive model control scheme integrates an MPC with kinematics to achieve effective positioning has been proposed to the robot reference frame.\u00a0 The end-effector of the soft robotic manipulator is controlled to move to the desired position using the MPC controller. Each segment is controlled by a dedicated MPC controller, with a total of three controllers for a three-segment manipulator to ensure precise control.\u00a0\n\nThe dynamic coupling analysis of the chaser base in a free-floating model was performed, examining the stability of rigid and soft robots operating under the same conditions. Simulations were conducted, and the results showed that the performance of soft robots was better than that of rigid robots. The findings reveal the potential advantages of soft robots in space exploration missions\u00a0\n\nThe approach of the deriving dynamics equations for a soft robot is under verifying (for free floating case). Currently the position error between the SimMechanics and the dynamics equations is on the level of 10-9.\u00a0\n\nContact\n:\u00a0\nxiaoqian@agh.edu.pl\n\nKeywords\n:\u00a0---\n\nSelected Publications\n:\n\nSoft robots for On-Orbit Servicing\n (OOS) missions\u00a0\n\n Dissolutionof minerals in Space \n\nResearch leader\n:\u00a0Dr. Eng.

Studies show that these unique space environments can hasten the onset of neurodegenerative, metabolic, and autoimmune disorders. Findings also suggest that organ-on-a-chip technology is a promising tool for replicating human organ systems under space-like conditions, allowing for the development of more effective, targeted therapies and personalized treatments.\n\nContact\n:\u00a0\nMlyniec@agh.edu.pl\n\nKeywords\n:\u00a0---\n\nSelected Publications\n: ---\u00a0\n\nStopka\n\nResearch\n\nProjects\n\nContact\n\nLogo to download\n\nBack", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.ctk.agh.edu.pl/en/research-groups", "title": " Research -- Space Technology Centre ", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "1c4a797ef2f17af26b90ced3f9980efd", "word_count": 2591, "headings": [{"level": 1, "text": "Research"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Stopka"}]}}

Such a person receives a doctoral scholarship in the amount increased by 30%.\n\nThe amount of the minimum basic salary for a professor at a public university specified in the regulation is\nPLN 9.370,00.\n\nThe doctoral scholarship is not subject to income tax. Instead, doctoral students studying at doctoral schools and receiving a doctoral scholarship are covered by mandatory pension and accident insurance. Sickness insurance is voluntary.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nPolish students\n\nThe university is required to register for health insurance those PhD students who are not otherwise covered. This official requirement arises on the day on which the doctoral student files a \nstatement\n confirming that they are not subject to health insurance requirement arising from another source, yet not earlier than on the date of commencing the first semester of education. It expires upon completion of the course of doctoral studies or disenrollment.\n\nAny change in the eligibility for insurance, such as acquiring/losing sickness pension entitlement, undertaking employment under an employment contract or a civil-law service contract [umowa zlecenie] and/or loss of insurance eligibility as a family member upon reaching the age of 26, requires the immediate submission of the aforementioned statement. Registration for health insurance in connection with circumstances other than the PhD student status will automatically result in the loss of health benefits based on this eligibility criterion.\n\nShould the PhD student be deregistered from health insurance based on circumstances other than the PhD student status, they will automatically lose their entitlement to health benefits.\n\nEligibility for health benefits does not automatically arise from being a PhD student; the University will make a registration for the insurance only on the basis of the statement submitted by the student.\n\nRegistration for health insurance by the University does not reduce the amount of the doctoral scholarship.\n\nOn graduation from the Doctoral School, student\u2019s eligibility for health care benefits will expire after 4 months of the date of graduation or disenrollment.\n\nNon-EU or EFTA PhD Students\n\nIf you are a PhD student from outside the European Union or from a country that is not European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member state, studying in Poland without being entitled to health insurance from another source, you may request for insurance cover on a voluntary basis. To do so, without any involvement on the part of the Doctoral School, you should:\n\nbe registered for permanent residence in Poland and hold a valid PESEL ID\n\nvisit an NFZ office and apply for voluntary health insurance\n\nsign the insurance cover contract with NFZ once your application is approved\n\nvisit a ZUS office and complete the ZUS ZZA form within 7 days of signing the contract\n\nremember to pay health insurance contributions and file ZUS DRA forms on time.\n\nNFZ\n\nZUS\n\nSocial Insurance\n\nDoctoral scholarship, regardless of the student's place of origin, is subject to deductions for mandatory old age pension and disability insurance. Social insurance contributions for PhD students are calculated based on the gross amount of the doctoral scholarship.\n\nThe old age pension contribution is financed in equal parts by the student and the University (9.76% each). The disability pension contribution is covered by the student in the amount of 1.5% of the reference amount [podstawa sk\u0142adki] while the University covers 6.5% of the reference amount. The accident insurance contribution is fully covered by the University.\n\nPhD students may apply for voluntary sickness insurance. The sickness insurance contribution is calculated as 2.45% of the gross amount of the doctoral scholarship and is financed by the student. To enroll in this insurance, the student must submit the required \nstatement\n.\n\nDuring the suspension of education, to determine the amount of doctoral scholarship, the provisions regarding the determination of maternity allowance shall apply, however, the basis for the calculation of the allowance shall be the amount of the monthly doctoral scholarship that is available on the day of submission of the application for suspension.\n\nPhD students may apply to their university units for the award of an increased doctoral scholarship funded by subsidies by 7th October 2024.\n\nWniosek o przyznanie stypendium doktoranckiego za osi\u0105gni\u0119cia naukowe\n\nRegulamin wyp\u0142acania stypendium doktoranckiego dla doktorant\u00f3w szk\u00f3\u0142 doktorskich\n\nZarz\u0105dzenie Nr 46/2023 Rektora Akademii G\u00f3rniczo-Hutniczej im.

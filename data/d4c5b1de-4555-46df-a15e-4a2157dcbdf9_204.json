In 2012, the quarterly Wiertnictwo Nafta Gaz\u202f was transferred into AGH Drilling, Oil, Gas and in 2021 into Journal of Geotechnology and Energy. As a result of this development, the thematic scope of accepted articles has been broadened.\n\nWe publish original articles concerning theoretical and applied research. Discussion and review papers presenting the current state of the art as well as new and emerging scientific ideas are also welcomed. Main areas of interest of the journal are: energy, geomechanics, geotechnics, drilling, reservoir engineering, geology, petroleum engineering, logging, management and protection of reservoirs, geothermal energy, groundwater, natural gas industry, hydrogen energy, CCS/CCSU, sustainable energy and environment.\n\nArticles are published in\u202f\nEnglish. \nPublication of scientific articles in Journal of\u00a0Geotechnology\u00a0and Energy is\u00a0\nfree of charge\n, while our journal is non-profit.\n\nJournal of Geotechnology and Energy is sponsored in full by AGH University of Krakow and published by \nAGH University Press\n.\n\n\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\n\n\t\t\t\tVol. 41 No. 4 (2024)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPublished:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2024-12-30\n\n\t\t\t\tFull Issue\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\tArticles\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tActivation of a dewatering well with clay mineral disintegration agent SKINAUT\n\n\t\t\tJan Macuda\n\n5-9\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimulations of the behavior of a pipeline made from three different types of materials on a landslide.\n\n\t\t\tIwona Kowalska-Kubsik\n\n11-20\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse of an inclined boreholes as an injection holes for filling the backfill chambers\n\n\t\t\tPrzemyslaw Toczek, Tomasz Kowalski, Rafa\u0142 Artym\n\n21-26\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMathematical model to analyze geometric limitations of mechatronic devices moving in curved pipe sections\n\n\t\t\tAdam Zwierzy\u0144ski\n\n27-34\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSecondary arsenates from the \u013dubietov\u00e1-Sv\u00e4todu\u0161n\u00e1 copper deposit in Slovakia\n\n\t\t\tUrszula Solecka\n\n35-42\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPossibilities of applying the extended Eyring rheological model in the technology of cement slurries used in oil drilling\n\n\t\t\tKrzysztof Skrzypaszek\n\n43-54\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvaluation of operating conditions of filtration columns of relief wells sited within the Mining Waste Disposal Facility \u201e\u017belazny Most\u201d\n\n\t\t\tJan Macuda\n\n53-60\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUsing Surface Geophysical Methods to Detect Voids in the Near-surface Zone\n\n\t\t\tMicha\u0142 Maruta\n\n61-69\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAn Investigation of soil conditions in a selected section of a railway cut as a basis for designing geoengineering works to improve their geotechnical parameters\n\n\t\t\tPrzemyslaw Toczek, Tomasz  Kowalski, Krzysztof Skrzypaszek, Cezary Ca\u0142y\n\n71-82\n\n\tPDF\n\n\t\t\t\tView All Issues", "metadata": {"url": "https://www.wydawnictwo.agh.edu.pl/strona/990-journal-geotechnology-and-energy", "title": "\n\t\tJournal of Geotechnology and Energy\n\t\t\t\t\t", "depth": 3, "duplicate": false, "content_hash": "43174187373c4a9e1694b1811b9561cb", "word_count": 413, "headings": [{"level": 2, "text": "About the Journal"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Current Issue"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Full Issue"}, {"level": 3, "text": "Articles"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Activation of a dewatering well with clay mineral disintegration agent SKINAUT"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Simulations of the behavior of a pipeline made from three different types of materials on a landslide."}, {"level": 4, "text": "Use of an inclined boreholes as an injection holes for filling the backfill chambers"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Mathematical model to analyze geometric limitations of mechatronic devices moving in curved pipe sections"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Secondary arsenates from the \u013dubietov\u00e1-Sv\u00e4todu\u0161n\u00e1 copper deposit in Slovakia"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Possibilities of applying the extended Eyring rheological model in the technology of cement slurries used in oil drilling"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Evaluation of operating conditions of filtration columns of relief wells sited within the Mining Waste Disposal Facility \u201e\u017belazny Most\u201d"}, {"level": 4, "text": "Using Surface Geophysical Methods to Detect Voids in the Near-surface Zone"}, {"level": 4, "text": "An Investigation of soil conditions in a selected section of a railway cut as a basis for designing geoengineering works to improve their geotechnical parameters"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Information"}, {"level": 2, "text": "Make a Submission"}]}}

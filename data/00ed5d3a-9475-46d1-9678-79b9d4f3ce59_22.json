He\u00a0gave more than one hundred seminars/lectures during international conferences/symposiums and some invited lectures (outside of Poland). His main field of interest is focus to\u00a0history of the Alpine structures from Africa (Morocco \u2013 High Atlas) trough European Alps/Carpathians and Himalaya-Karakoram-Tibet realms, especially from Jurassic perspective.\nHe\u00a0is the leader of the International GeosCience Programme 710 (IGCP 710) under the auspices of UNESCO (2020-2024) untitled: Western Tethys meets Eastern Tethys, and memeber of several others IGCP projects. He\u00a0is the Editor-in-Chief of Geotourism magazine \u2013 international journal of geosciences, geoparks and Earth sciences. At\u00a0the AGH UST he\u00a0is Coordinator for bilateral cooperation with universities of Southeast Asian countries (including Nepal) on\u00a0both scientific and educational levels. His long-term cooperation with these countries increases impact on\u00a0strengthening academic ties and openness.\n\nAsst.Professor Kabi Raj Paudyal\u00a0\n\nCentral Department of Geology\n\nTribhuvan University\n\nKathmandu, Nepal\ne-mail:\u00a0\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

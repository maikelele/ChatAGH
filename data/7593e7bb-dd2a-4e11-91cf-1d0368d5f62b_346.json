It is a continuation of European educational initiatives that started in 1998. The programme aims to support pupils, students, teachers, lecturers, and volunteers in conducting international projects that enhance competencies. Therefore, institutions and organizations, both public and private, supporting formal education as well as non-formal and informal learning for people of all ages, are also eligible to participate in the programme. The European budget for the programme for the years 2021\u20132027 is 26.2 billion euros. With the new financial perspective, the scope of Erasmus+ was expanded, making it more innovative and inclusive, as well as more digital. It will also play a key role in the creation of the European Education Area, scheduled to be launched by 2025. Through the \u00a0European Education Area, the European Union intends, among other things, to ensure that all young people have access to the highest quality education and training, to enable learners to move easily between education systems in different countries and to give them the opportunity to find work across Europe.\n\nPolish Foundation for the Development of the Education System is the National Agency for the Erasmus+ Programme, responsible for implementing the programme in Poland.\n\nStopka\n\nAGH University Doctoral School\nbuild.

One of the most important manifestations of care for the scientific integrity of books and journals published by us is the procedure of their reviewing, the rules of which are presented below.\n\nIn accordance with the Regulation No. 5/2013 of the Rector of AGH, the scope of activity of AGH University Press includes publishing scripts and academic textbooks, scientific periodicals, aperiodicals, dissertations and monographs, as well as, at the Rector's request, other publishing items important for the university. All the scientific publications published by AGH University Press are submitted to scientific review whose purpose is to evaluate the material, point out the shortcomings, formulate remarks for the author and clear suggestion for the Publishers if the work should be published.\n\nHow to prepare materials for editorial\n\nText Preparation:\n\nThe text submitted for the paper should generally be its finished version, and the Author should make every effort to provide materials of the best possible quality. In particular, the editors ask that the bibliography be prepared in a reliable manner and that reliable sources be used. Descriptions of individual items should be shaped according to the same principles, always in the original language, in the case of Cyrillic script possibly in transcription.\n\nPreparation of figures:\n\nThe graphs and diagrams prepared by the authors should have a consistent graphic and typographical layout and should follow the same spelling rules as those used in the text. We recommend not deleting the source files from graphics programs so that corrections to the drawings can be easily made.\n\nThe size of figures in the author's copy should in principle correspond to the size in which they are to be printed in the book (standard book format\n\n\tin AGH University Press is B5 with a printing field of 13 \u00d7 19 cm). The editors request that descriptions on diagrams and graphs be of appropriate size to ensure legibility.\n\nScanned illustrative material should be saved in formats: TIF, JPG or EPS. Scanned color photographs should have a resolution of at least 300 dpi, black and white photographs - 600 dpi, and black and white drawings (line drawings) - 1200 dpi.\n\nUse of copyrighted materials\n\nText fragments, illustrations, figures, tables, etc. originating from other works are protected by copyright under the Act of 4 February 1994 on Copyright and Related Rights (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2006, No. 90, item 631, as amended). Therefore, it is required to clearly indicate the source not only in the literature list, but also in the caption of the figure, photograph, table, and to have the permission of the copyright owner of the reprinted fragment for its use. These requirements apply to both Polish and foreign works. Obtaining permission is the responsibility of the author. Lack of such permission and failure to provide the source is a violation of copyright and entails all legal consequences. The inclusion in the book of material protected by copyright taken from other publications is possible on condition that the Author has previously supplied the Publisher with the written consent of the copyright owner for the use of the above material in the Author's work.\n\nReview Process\n\nTwo reviewers are chosen by the dean of the author's faculty from among specialists in a given scientific discipline who are independent scientific workers. There is a requirement that at least one reviewer must be from outside the author's affiliating unit. The reviewer must not have a conflict of interest with the author, particularly with regard to: direct personal relations with the author (kinship, legal ties, conflict), relations of professional subordination with the author, direct scientific cooperation with the author - such state shall be certified in writing. In the case of articles in scientific journals, two reviewers are selected by the editorial committee of the journal according to the double blind review principle. The collective list of reviewers in a given yearbook is usually published in the last issue of the yearbook.\n\n\tThe review must be in writing and concluded with an unequivocal conclusion as to whether the paper should be accepted for publication or rejected. The review should focus on the substantive level, originality of the theses, legitimacy of the research, methodology, correctness of the formulated conclusions and the manner of their presentation. The review should be fair, objective, reliable, constructive, consistent with the knowledge possessed and completed on time. The reviewer is obliged to disclose any plagiarism or suspected plagiarism or self-plagiarism, as well as failures to cite data (data manipulation). The reviewer is obliged not to use knowledge about the reviewed work before its publication.\n\n\tThe author receives the review for review, responds to it and prepares a revised version of the work. He or she then delivers the revised version of the work to Publishers along with a statement that he or she has read and taken into account the reviewers' comments.\n\n\tIn case of doubt or at the reviewer's request, the Publishing House may refer the revised version of the work for a second review.\n\n\tAGH University Press has the right not to accept and refuse to publish a work that has received a negative review.\n\nGuidelines for registration of a publication\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Rb-D.0201-1-65/23\n\n\tORDER No. 65/2023\n\n\tRector of the AGH University of Krakow\n\n\tdated October 3, 2023.\n\nOn the mode of registration of publication achievements of students, doctoral students and employees of the AGH University of Krakow.\n\n\tPursuant to Article 23 of the Law of July 20, 2018. - Law on Higher Education and Science (i.e., Journal of Laws of 2023, item 742, as amended) and \u00a7 20(2) of the Statutes of AGH (adopted by Resolution No. 137/2019 of the AGH Senate of June 26, 2019, as amended), I order as follows:\n\n\u00a71\n\n1. The publication output of employees, students and doctoral students of the AGH University of Krakow is registered in the Database of Authors and Publications of AGH (hereinafter referred to as \"BaDAP AGH\" or \"the Database\"); the processing of bibliographic data is the responsibility of the staff of the Main Library.\n\n2. In BaDAP, bibliographic data of publications are registered on the basis of originals provided by authors or information sent by them electronically, provided that they allow to make a description in accordance with bibliographic standards. It is also the responsibility of the authors to prepare an English version of the titles of publications, if such do not appear in the originals. After the bibliographic description is prepared, the materials deposited in the Main Library are returned to the authors.\n\n3. The Database documents the publication output of the authors from the period of their employment at AGH, training at the doctoral school, doctoral studies or studies held at the University at each level and in each form. In exceptional situations, publications created before the period of employment at AGH are also registered in BaDAP, if this is related to the completion of the author's list of publications - then in the description of the publication the information \"no AGH affiliation\" appears.\n\n4. Descriptions of publications from 1999 onward are included in the Database; publications from earlier years are registered only if their descriptions did not appear in the printed version of the Bibliography of Publications of AGH Employees or if the author requests so.\n\n5. Descriptions of works are entered into the Database also when the affiliation next to the name of the author(s) is other than AGH; in the case when the lack of affiliation next to the author's name is due to reasons beyond the author's control (publishing policy of the institutions publishing the materials) - then in the description of the publication the information \"no AGH affiliation\" appears.\n\n6. The staff of the Main Library does not select materials in terms of their content, leaving the decision in this regard to the authors of publications.\n\n7. Bibliography does not record descriptions of documents that lack the basis for bibliographic description.\n\n8. In the periodic evaluation of AGH employees, incentive systems and awards for scientific activity, in which achievements related to scientific activity conducted at AGH are shown, the University Authorities take into account only publications registered in the Database in accordance with the procedure established by this Ordinance.\n\n9. Bibliographic materials should be submitted to the Scientific Information Branch of the AGH Main Library (room 215, 1st floor). Information on bibliographic materials to be included in the Database may be sent by e-mail to the address of the Scientific Information Branch: oin@bg.agh.edu.pl or by other means, specified by a separate announcement on the BaDAP website.\n\n\u00a7 2.\n\n\t1.

The Ordinance shall come into force on the date of signature.\n\nOpen Access\n\nPublications under the \"Open Access\" tab are made available under a Creative Commons license or a perpetual non-exclusive license granted to AGH.

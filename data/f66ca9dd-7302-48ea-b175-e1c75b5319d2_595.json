DMMS objective is to serve the entire Decision Making community, including academic and industry researchers and decision makers working at the interface of research and implementation in manufacturing and services.\u00a0The journal encourages a variety of methodological approaches to decision making in manufacturing and services. The papers may be theoretical or empirical, analytical or computational, and may be based on a variety of disciplinary foundations such as management, economics, operations research, computer science, engineering, psychology, etc. The DMMS also publishes state of the art reports by invited authors, critical reviews and special issues devoted to particular topics.\n\n\t\t\t\tCurrent Issue\n\n\t\t\t\tVol. 18 (2024)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPublished:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2024-12-30\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResilience of Robotic Solutions in Extreme Conditions\n\n\t\t\tDariusz Sala, Pavlo Pikulin, Valentyn Sobchuk, Igor Kotsan\n\n5-18\n\n\tPDF\n\n                DOI:\n\n        https://doi.org/10.7494/dmms.2024.18.6054\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSix Sigma vs. other quality improvement tools A comparative analysis of trends in years 1985-2024\n\n\t\t\tMarcin Nakielski, Anna Ludwig\n\n19-38\n\n\tPDF\n\n                DOI:\n\n        https://doi.org/10.7494/dmms.2024.18.6227\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPredictions and Application of Queueing Analysis: A Case of Regional Hospital Limbe, Cameroon\n\n\t\t\tDaphne T.
